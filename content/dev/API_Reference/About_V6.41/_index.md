The API Reference provides information on Teamwork's APIs which allow you to transfer data either to or from Teamwork Commerce PRO. This reference is divided into several sections.

Before beginning to interact with Teamwork's APIs you ***must*** familiarize yourself with all of the topics in the **How tos** section.

In addition, you *should* familiarize yourself with the topics in the **Supporting information** section, particularly the *JSON Data Types* topic.

Once you have familiarized yourself with the above, you can begin making use of the individual APIs described in the **Import APIs** and **Export APIs** sections.

{{% notice info %}}
It should be noted that all of the documents in the API Reference are identified with a CHQ version number. All documents apply to that CHQ version and higher unless a document with a higher version exists.

For example, *Document 1 [6.41]* indicates that that document applies to CHQ version 6.41 and higher.

In a list of documents a given document could appear multiple times. For example, in a list there could be:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Document 1 [6.41]*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Document 2 [6.41]*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Document 2 [6.43]*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Document 3 [6.41]*

*Document 1* and *Document 3* exist once and apply to CHQ versions 6.41 and higher.

*Document 2* occurs twice in the list, once for version 6.41 and once for 6.43. *Document 2 [6.41]* applies to CHQ versions 6.41 and 6.42. *Document 2 (6.43)* applies to CHQ version 6.43 and higher.

You should read the copy of the document which is identified as being for your version of CHQ. If there is none, you should read the document identified as being for the most recent CHQ version prior to your version.

For example, assume that the following document copies exist:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Document 1 [6.41]*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Document 1 [6.43]*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Document 1 [6.44]*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Document 1 [6.46]*

If you are on CHQ version 6.43, you should read *Document 1 [6.43]*. If you are on CHQ version 6.45 you should read *Document 1 [6.44]* because there is no 6.45 version of the document and the most recent prior version is for 6.44. If you are on CHQ version 6.49 you should read *Document 1 [6.46]* because there is no 6.49 version of the document and the most recent prior version is for 6.46.
