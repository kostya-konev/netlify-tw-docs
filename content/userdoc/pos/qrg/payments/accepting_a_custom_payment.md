In Teamwork Commerce Suite, retailers can set up payment methods unique to their business.

To be available in POS Pro, Custom payment methods must be set up in CHQ under `settings > sales > payment methods` and marked as **visible** for the store location. The payment method name displayed in POS Pro is defined in CHQ too.

To finalize a Sales Receipt in POS Pro using the Custom payment method:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **New Sale**.

2. In the **Sales Receipt** area, add sale items and a customer to the receipt.

3. Tap **Payment** at the bottom-right.

4. In the **Payment** area, tap **[your Custom payment method]**.

6. If the **Custom Field** dialog appears (available only if set in CHQ), fill in the **Custom Text Label** field and tap **Done**.

7. Back in the **Payments** area, to edit the Custom payment record or remove it from the receipt, swipe left that record and then select the required option (**A** in the picture):
