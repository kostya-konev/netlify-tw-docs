A Gift Card is a prepaid money card that the customer can use as a payment method within one retail company.Â 
{{% notice info %}}
A customer can have gift cards from different fiscal zones. At the same time, in POS, a gift card can be redeemed only within the same fiscal zone where it was issued. That means that, for example, a gift card in British pounds cannot be redeemed in a U.S. store.

To accept a Gift Card payment, in POS Pro V6:

1. On the **Home** **Screen**, tap **New** **Sale**.

2. In the **Sales** **Receipt** area that opens, add a customer and sale items. To learn how to do that, see [Sales Receipt: Adding a customer and items to the sale](/userdoc/pos/qrg/sr/adding_customer_items/). Then, tap **Payment** at the bottom-right.

3. In the **Payment** area, tap **Gift** **Card** in the right-side panel.

4. In the **Gift** **Card** dialog (see the screenshot), if no customer was added under **Sales** **Receipt** \> **Customer**, search for the required Gift Card. To do so:

    - tap the **<i class="fas fa-barcode"></i> icon** {{% inum "A" %}} in the search field to scan the customer's Gift Card, or
    - enter the **full** Gift Card number in the search field

Alternatively, if the customer's account was added under `Sales Receipt > Customer`, the customer's Gift Cards display immediately on opening the **Gift** **Card** dialog.

5. Tap **Select** {{% inum "B" %}} next to the required Gift Card.

6. In the area with **Amount** **Due** that opens, tap the amount field to edit it. Then, tap **Pay** at the bottom.

7. Back in the **Payment** area, once the full payment amount is captured, tap **Finalize** at the bottom-right.

Alternatively, to remove or edit the payment, swipe left the row with the Gift Card payment and then tap **Remove** or **Edit**, respectively.
