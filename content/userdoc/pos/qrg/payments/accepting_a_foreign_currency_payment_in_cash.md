In POS Pro, it is possible to accept cash payments in foreign currencies.  
To make this payment method available, a currency different from the location’s base currency as well as its exchange rates must be configured in CHQ.

To accept a cash payment in a foreign currency, in POS Pro:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **New Sale**.

2. In the **Sales Receipt** area, add sale items and a customer to the sale.

3. Tap **Payment** at the bottom-right.

4. In the right-side panel, tap the required foreign currency payment:

5. In the **[currency name]** area that opens, tap to define the payment amount in the foreign {{% inum "1" %}} or base {{% inum "2" %}} currency:
{{% gimg src="6.34 QRG/634_qrg_8.png" width="700px"%}} 
Editing either of the fields results in recalculating the other. The **Amount Due** in both currencies as well as the exchange rate are displayed in the right-side panel {{% inum "3" %}}.

6. Tap **PAY** at the bottom.

7. Back in the **Payment** area, it’s possible to edit the foreign currency payment by tapping it in the left-side panel.

8. Tap **FINALIZE** at the bottom-right.
