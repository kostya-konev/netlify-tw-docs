POS Pro allows customers to pay with a check.  
To be available in POS Pro, the Check payment method must be set up in CHQ under `settings > sales > payment methods` and marked as **visible** for the store location.

To accept a Check payment, in POS Pro:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **New Sale**.

2. In the **Sales Receipt** area, add a customer and sale items.

3. Tap **Payment** at the bottom-right.

4. In the **Payment** area, tap **Check** (the name of the method is configured in CHQ):

6. Tap **Done** in the upper right corner.
7. Back in the **Payment** area, the respective check payment record appears on the left. To view or remove it, swipe left the payment row (highlighted in the screenshot) and then select the required option:

8. Once the full payment amount is accepted, tap **Finalize** at the bottom-right.
