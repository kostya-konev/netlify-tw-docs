In POS PRO, it is possible to create an Adjustment Memo from a Count Memo. The Adjustment memo updates the stock ledger quantities based on the Count Memo item difference.

To create an Adjustment Memo from a Count Memo:

1. Tap **Count Memos** in the app's **Home Screen** navigation panel or in the fly-out **More** menu (the location of the button is defined by your custom settings).

2. In **Count Memos**, tap the required Count Memo to open it.

3. In the required Count Memo, tap **Create Adjustment** at the top. On tapping, the **Create Adjustment** dialog opens:

In the **Create Adjustment** dialog that opens:
- the **Items** fields show the number of PLUs affected

- the **Quantity** fields show the total item quantity being adjusted

To define a reason for adjustment, tap **Select** in the **Adjustment Memo reason** field (**required**).

Optionally, to archive the Count Memo on creation of the Adjustment Memo, toggle the **Automatically Archive Count Memo** switch on.

Once done, tap **Create** in the upper right corner of the dialog.
