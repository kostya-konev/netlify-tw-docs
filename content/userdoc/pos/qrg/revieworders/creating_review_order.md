A Review Order (RVO) is a potential sale where the customer takes merchandise home for review before purchasing. At the time of RVO creation, the store associate can take a deposit. 

When in review, items remain on hand in the inventory but are taken out from available-to-sell (ATS).

After reviewing, the customer can buy desired items and return the rest.

To create a Review Order in POS PRO: 

1. On the Home Screen, tap **NEW SALE**.

2. Tap **New Review Order**. Depending on your custom settings, the button can be located at the top of the right-side panel {{% inum "A" %}} or in the **More** menu {{% inum "B" %}}:
