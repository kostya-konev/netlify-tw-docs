A Review Order (RVO) is a potential sale where the customer takes merchandise home for review before purchasing. At the time of RVO creation, the store associate can take a deposit. 

When in review, items remain on hand in the inventory but are taken out from available-to-sell (ATS).

After reviewing, the customer can buy desired items and return the rest. 

To sell items from an RVO, in POS PRO:

1. On the Home Screen, tap **Sales Receipts**. Depending on your custom settings, the **Sales Receipts** button may be located in the navigation panel at the bottom or in the **More** menu.

2. In the **Sales Receipts** area, tap the **Review** tab:

3. On the tab, find and tap your RVO. 

4. In the **Review Order** area that opens, tap **SELECT ITEMS TO SELL** {{% inum "A" %}}:

If the customer is returning all items, it's possible to discard the RVO by tapping **Close** in the upper-left corner and then selecting **Delete Review Order**.  
Note that deleting does **NOT** refund any taken deposits automatically. To refund, find the associated Sales Receipt with the deposit Credit Memo and then make a Verified Return against that Receipt.
