Adjustment Memos are used to record changes in quantities of the merchandise if, for example, some of your store's items have been stolen, damaged, found, or returned to another store.

To create an Adjustment Memo, in POS PRO:

1. Tap **Adjustments** in the app's **Home Screen** navigation panel or in the fly-out **More** menu (the location of the button is defined by your custom settings).

2. In the **Adjustments** area, tap **New Adjustment** at the top-right:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image35.png" width="300px" %}}
3. On tapping **New Adjustment**, select the required adjustment reason. Once the reason is selected, the **Document** tab of the created Adjustment Memo will open.

4. Tap **Items** at the top-right.  

Initially, the **Items** tab contains no items. There are two ways you can add items to the list:

- scan the item's barcode (preferred)
- enter the item's UPC, PLU, CLU, or your item's description in the **Item Search** field {{% inum "A" %}}
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image36.png" width="700px" %}}
5. To manually specify **Adjustment Qty**, swipe left the item's row and tap **Edit** {{% inum "B" %}}.  
Once **Adjustment Qty** is indicated, it is possible to set the value to be positive or negative. To do so, on the virtual keyboard, tap the **+/-** button. Once done, tap **Save**.

Alternatively, to set the item value to either positive or negative by default, tap the **Options** button next to the **Search** field:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image37.png" width="500px" %}} 
In the **Default Item Value** field, select the required option.

6. If required, to print the Adjustment Memo, tap **Print** in the upper right corner.  
Also, to automatically print the Adjustment Memo on finalizing, you can turn on the **Print on Finalize** switch at the bottom.

7. Tap **FINALIZE**.
