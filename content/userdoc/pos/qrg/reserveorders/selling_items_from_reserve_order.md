A Reserve Order allows for reserving items on the customer's request. If the customer has decided to purchase a reserved item, the Reserve Order can be converted into a Sales Receipt.

To convert a Reserve Order into a Sales Receipt, in POS PRO:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **Reserve Orders**. Depending on your custom settings, the **Reserve Orders** button may be located in the navigation panel at the bottom or in the **More** menu.

2. In the **Reserve Orders** area, find and tap the Order that you want to convert to a sale. 

3. In the **Reserve Order** area that opens, it's possible to cancel items that the customer is not buying. To do so, on the **Items** tab, swipe an item row left and then tap **Cancel Item** {{% inum "A" %}}:

{{% notice info %}}
Cancelled items are returned to the `available-to-sell` inventory and are not transferred to the Sales Receipt.
{{% /notice %}}
Then, tap **Re-Release** at the bottom-right.

4. At the bottom-left, tap **Sell** {{% inum "B" %}}:

5. In the confirmation dialog that appears, tap **Sell & Archive**.

6. In the **Sales Receipt** area that opens, optionally, edit the transaction as required: add items, discounts, coupons, etc.

7. Tap **PAY** at the bottom-right.

8. In the **Payment** area, choose a payment method and then accept the payment.

9. Tap **Finalize**.
