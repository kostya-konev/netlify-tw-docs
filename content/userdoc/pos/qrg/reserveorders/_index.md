A Reserve Order allows for reserving items in-store on the customer's request or if, for example, those items are out for cleaning or repair. 

In the **Reserve Orders** area, it is possible to view information on existing Reserve Orders, search for and edit a specific Order as well as create a new Order.

1. To open the **Reserve Orders** area, on the **Home Screen** of POS PRO, tap **Reserve Orders**. Depending on your custom settings, the button can be located in the navigation bar at the bottom or in the **More** menu.  

2. In the area that opens, to search for a specific Order:

    - tap **Scan** {{% inum "A" %}} and then scan the printed Order, or
    - use the **Search** field for manual entry {{% inum "B" %}}

Scanning and searching is possible by the Order's **Universal #**, **Order #**, or the customer's name, primary email, or primary phone number.

3. To sort the list of Reserve Orders by a specific column, tap that column's name once to change the order from descending to ascending.

4. To configure default printing settings for a Reserve Order, tap **Print Options** in the upper right corner.

5. To view or edit the details of a Reserve Order, tap that Order in the list.
