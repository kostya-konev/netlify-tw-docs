In POS PRO, it's possible to assign multiple store associates to an item in the Sales Receipt. For retailers that utilize commission based pay, this feature allows for splitting a sale item’s value between several associates.

Additionally, the user can manually distribute the percentage of the sale value among the assigned associates. 

To add multiple associates at the item level, in POS PRO:

1. On the Home Screen, tap **New Sale**.

2. On the **Cart** tab of the **Sales Receipt** area, add sale item(s).

3. Swipe left the required item and then tap **Edit**.

4. In the area that opens, tap the **Item Details** tab.

4. On the **Item Details** tab, tap the value in the **Associate** field:

5. Tap **ADD** {{% inum "A" %}}:

6. In the **Select Associate** dialog that opens, use the **Search** field to find and add the required associate. On adding an associate, sale value percentage is distributed automatically. 

7. To allocate the sale percentage manually, back in the **Item Associates** dialog, tap the **PERCENT** value for an associate {{% inum "B" %}} and then enter the desired percentage:

{{% notice note %}}
Please be advised that, if the percentage is manually changed for one of the associates, it’s required to do so for *all* associates on the item. Also, all 100% must be allocated before the **Save** button in the upper-right corner is enabled.
{{% /notice %}}

8. Tap **Save** in the upper right corner.  

9. Tap **Done**.

Back in the **Sales Receipt** area, the item that has multiple associates assigned will have the **Associates (number)** label applied. 

9. Finalize the transaction as required.
