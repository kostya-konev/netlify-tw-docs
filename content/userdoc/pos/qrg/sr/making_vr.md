​
A Verified Return is a return transaction that is linked to the original sale. Such linking allows for easy verification that the merchandise was sold to the customer as well as transferring item details – such as fees and discounts – from the sale to the return. 

To make a Verified Return, in POS PRO:
​
1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **New Sale**.
​
2. In the **Sales Receipt** area, tap **Find Receipt** at the top of the right-side panel {{% inum "A" %}} or in the fly-out menu {{% inum "B" %}}:

{{% notice note %}}
Alternatively, if you have no physical sales receipt on hand, it's possible to search for the original transaction in the following POS areas:
- `Sales Receipt > Customer tab > Purchase History`
- `Customers > [selected customer] > See More > Purchase History`
- `Sales Receipts > Sales History`
- `Sales Receipts > Device History`

3. In the **Find Receipt** area, find the original receipt by:
    - tapping the **barcode** icon at the top and then scanning the physical receipt with the camera, or
    - manually entering the **Transaction #**, **Web Order #**, or **RMA Code** from the receipt into the **Search** field and then tapping **return** on the keyboard

{{% gimg src="V6.42 QRG/6.42_qrg_2.jpg" width="500px"%}}
    - Tap the item(s) that should be returned. Items included in the verified return display as blue rows with a checkmark icon {{% inum "A" %}}.
    - In the **Return Reason** pop-over that appears, select a return reason {{% inum "B" %}}.
    - To define the return quantity, tap the **RETURN QTY** field in an item's row {{% inum "C" %}}. 
    - To edit the fees that are to be returned, tap **Select** (or the current value) in the **FEES** field {{% inum "D" %}}.
    - When all return items are configured, tap **Return Item(s)** at the bottom-right {{% inum "E" %}}.

{{% notice tip %}}
To quickly mark all items as return, in the **RETURN ALL** field on the right, tap **Select Reason** and then choose a return reason. All items on the receipt will be selected and the chosen return reason applied.
