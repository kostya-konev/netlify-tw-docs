This guide describes how to increment the balance of an existing Gift Card (GC). 

To do so, in POS PRO:

1. On the Home Screen, tap **NEW SALE**.

2. In the **Sales Receipt** area that opens, tap **GC Purchase**.   
Depending on your custom settings, the **GC Purchase** button can be located at the top of the right-side panel {{% inum "A" %}} or in the **More** menu {{% inum "B" %}}:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image82.png" width="700px" %}}

3. In the **Gift Card Purchase** dialog that opens, select the provider of your GC:
{{% gimg src="V6.40 QRG/6.40_qrg_7.jpg" width="400px" %}}
Then, in the **Gift Card Search** field below, tap the **barcode** icon to scan your GC or, alternatively, enter the *full* GC number manually.

4. Once the GC is found, define the amount you want to load. To do so:
{{% gimg src="V6.40 QRG/6.40_qrg_8.jpg" width="400px" %}}
    - tap one of the predefined amounts {{% inum "A" %}}, or
    - fill out the **Add Amount** field {{% inum "B" %}}

5. Tap **Done** in the upper right corner.

6. Back in the **Sales Receipt** area, tap **PAY**.

7. In the **Payment** area that opens, choose a payment method and then accept the payment.

8. Tap **Finalize**.
