In the **Sales Receipts** area of POS, it is possible to:

- start a Verified Return
- void/reverse a transaction
- email, print, and reprint receipts and invoices

To open the **Sales Receipts** area, on POS **Home Screen**, tap **Sales Receipts**. The **Sales Receipts** button is located either in the navigation panel at the bottom {{% inum "A" %}} or in the **More** menu {{% inum "B" %}} depending on your settings:

In the area that opens, the following tabs are available:
{{% notice info %}}
Availability and order of the tabs depend on your custom settings.
{{% /notice %}}

- **On Hold**: held Sales Receipts created on your device
- **Sales History**: finalized Receipts from all devices at your location
- **Device History**: finalized Receipts created on your device
- **Review**: Review Orders created on your device

To find a specific transaction in **Sales History** or **Device History**, use the **Find Receipt** option:

In the dialog that opens, scan the physical receipt or manually enter full **Trans #**, **Order #**, or **RMA Code** of the receipt.

On the **Review** tab, use the **Find Review** option to search by scanning or manually entering the Review Order number.

Alternatively, you can apply filters to the list of transactions by tapping **Filter** in the upper left corner. Sales Receipts can be filtered by date, location (not applicable in **Device History**), customer name, and credit card last 4 digits. Review Orders can be filtered by location, customer name, date, return date, and status.

To open the quick actions menu, swipe left the required transaction {{% inum "A" %}}:
{{% gimg src="V6.42 QRG/6.42_qrg_11.jpg" width="700px" %}} 
Depending on the transaction and your company's custom settings, options such as **Reprint**, **Email**, **Void/Reverse**, **Open**, and **View** may be available.

To view a historical transaction, tap the required line in the list. On tapping, the transaction opens in the **Return** mode that allows you to start a Verified Return (see [Making a Verified Return of merchandise](https://twdocs.netlify.app/userdoc/pos/qrg/sr/making_vr/)).

To void/reverse the transaction, in the **Return** area, tap **Void/Reverse** at the top-right (see [Voiding/reversing a Sales Receipt](https://twdocs.netlify.app/userdoc/pos/qrg/sr/voiding_reversing_a_sales_receipt/)).

To view the transaction in full, in the **Trans #** field, tap **View**:
