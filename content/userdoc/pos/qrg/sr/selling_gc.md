A Gift Card is a prepaid money card that the customer can use as a payment method within one retail company.
{{% notice info %}}
A customer can have gift cards from different fiscal zones. At the same time, in POS, a gift card can be redeemed only within the same fiscal zone where it was issued. That means that, for example, a gift card in British pounds cannot be redeemed in a U.S. store.
