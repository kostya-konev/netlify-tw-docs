To apply the same discount to multiple sale items, in POS:
​
1. On the **Home** **Screen**, tap **New Sale**.
​
2. In the **Sales** **Receipt** area that opens, tap **Cart** at the top {{% inum "A" %}}:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image76.png" width="600px" %}}
3. In the **Cart** tab, tap the **barcode** icon {{% inum "B" %}} in the right-side panel to scan the required items and add them to the cart. Alternatively, search for them manually via the **Item Search** field.
​
4. Once items are added to the cart, tap **Edit** **Many** at the bottom ({{% inum "C" %}} in the screenshot above). In the **Edit Many** area that opens, do the following:

    - Tap the **checkmark** icon next to the items that should be discounted. The checkmark icon should display in blue.\

    - Then, tap **Select** in the **REASON** field {{% inum "1" %}} to choose a discount reason:
    {{% gimg src="QRG_main/image77.png" width="500px" %}}

    - Optionally, to change the discount type ("Percentage" or "Amount"), tap the value in the **TYPE** field. Then, in the **TYPE** field {{% inum "2" %}}, enter the required discount percentage or amount, respectively.

    - If an authorization code is required (in the right-side panel, the **Authorization Code** field appears in bold and with `*`), enter the code.

    - Tap **Apply** **& Close** {{% inum "3" %}}.

Once the discount is applied, in the **Sales** **Receipt** area, the green `Discounts Applied` message appears at the top.
