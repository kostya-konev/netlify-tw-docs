An Open Return can occur when the customer returns merchandise without the original Sales Receipt.

To make an Open Return, in POS:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **New Sale**.

2. In the **Sales Receipt** area that opens, tap **Cart** {{% inum "A" %}} at the top:

3. In the **Cart** tab, to add a return item, do one of the following:

    - tap the **barcode** icon {{% inum "B" %}} in the right-side panel to scan the return item
    - scan the item with the connected RFID reader
    - search for the item manually via the **Item Search** field

4. Once the item is added to the cart, swipe the item row left and tap **Open Return** ({{% inum "C" %}} in the screenshot above). On tapping, the **Return** tab of the **\[item name\] -- edit** dialog opens.

5. In the **Return** tab, do the following:

    a. If no default return reason is defined, the **Return** **Reason** list {{% inum "1" %}} displays automatically:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image75.png" width="500px" %}}
In the list, tap the required reason. Once a return reason is defined, the **Return Values** and **Additional Information** sections become available below. 

    b. To add a discount to the return item, tap **Select** in the **DISCOUNT REASON** field.

    c. To add a fee to the return item, tap **Select** in the **FEE TYPE** field.

    d. To indicate the original sale location, date as well as the Sales Receipt number, under **Additional Information**, define the **ORIGINAL SALE LOCATION**, **ORIGINAL SALE DATE**, and **ORIGINAL RECEIPT \#** fields respectively.

e. Tap **Done** in the upper right corner of the area ({{% inum "2" %}} in the screenshot above).

6. Back in the **Sales** **Receipt** area, tap **PAY** to go to the **Payments** area.
