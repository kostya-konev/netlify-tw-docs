POS PRO allows for voiding and reversing finalized Sales Receipts.
​
To void/reverse a Sales Receipt, in POS Pro:

Depending on your custom settings, the **Sales Receipts** button can be found in the bottom navigation bar or in the **More** menu.
​
2. Tap **Device History** at the top.  
Now, you have three options to perform voiding/reversing:
​
    - Swipe left the required Sales Receipt and then tap **Void/Reverse**
