2. In the **Sales Receipt** area that opens, tap **Gift Card Transfer**. Depending on your custom settings, the **Gift Card Transfer** option may be located at the top of the right-side panel {{% inum "1" %}} or in the **More** menu {{% inum "2" %}}:

Once the GC is found, the following GC details will appear in the dialog:

    - **Gift Card #**: masked GC number
    - **Balance**: current balance on the GC
    - **Expiration Date**: expiration date of the GC including grace period
3. Tap the **To Card** dialog at the top.

4. On the **To Card** tab, search for the GC to which balance is to be transferred. To do so, tap the **barcode** icon to scan the GC or manually enter the GC number in the search field.  
Once the GC is found, the GC details display in the dialog, and the **Transfer** button becomes enabled.
