POS PRO allows users to check the balance of an existing gift card. This may be useful when, for example, the customer is deciding on a payment method.

To do so, in POS PRO:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **NEW SALE**.

2. In the **Sales Receipt** area, tap **PAY** at the bottom-right.

3. In the list of payments on the right, tap your **[Check GC Balance payment method]**:
{{% gimg src="V6.40 QRG/6.40_qrg_10.png" width="700px"%}}
{{% notice note %}}
The name of the payment method in POS PRO is based on your custom settings.
{{% /notice %}}
4. In the **Gift Card Balance** dialog that opens, select the provider of your GC:

Then, in the **Gift Card Search** field below, tap the **barcode** icon to scan your GC or, alternatively, enter the *full* GC number manually.  
Once found, the information about the GC, including **Balance**, appears in the dialog.

5. When finished reviewing, tap **Close** in the upper left corner to return to the **Payments** area.
