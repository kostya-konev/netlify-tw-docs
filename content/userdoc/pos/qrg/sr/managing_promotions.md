In POS PRO, promotions are automatically applied when items meeting the promo requirements are added to the Sales Receipt.

Once a promotion has been applied, in the **Cart** tab of the **Sales Receipt** area, the `Promotion(s) Applied. View Promos` message displays at the top.

1. To view the name and discount amount of each applied promotion, tap **View Promos** {{% inum "A" %}} in the message (or tap **View Promos** at the bottom of the area):
{{% gimg src="V6.40 QRG/6.40_qrg_3.png" width="700px" %}}
Additionally, in the **Promotions** dialog that opens, it's possible to manually remove a promotion by tapping **Remove Promo** {{% inum "B" %}}:
{{% gimg src="V6.40 QRG/6.40_qrg_4.jpg" width="400px" %}}

2. To see promotion details for a specific item or apply an additional discount on top of the promo, in the **Sales Receipt** area, tap the **Promo** tag next to the required item.

    a. In **Promos**, under **APPLIED PROMOTIONS** {{% inum "A" %}}, the list of all promotions applied to that item displays:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image73.png" width="600px" %}}
    b. To apply an additional discount to the item, under **ADD DISCOUNT**, tap **ADD** {{% inum "B" %}} next to the required discount type.  
    c. Then, tap **Done** in the upper right corner of the area.
