To create a Sales Receipt, first, you need to add sale items and a customer (optional) to it.

To do so, in POS:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **New Sale**.

2. In the **Sales Receipt** area that opens, on the **Customer** tab, add a customer record.

To search for an existing customer, use the search field at the top {{% inum "A" %}}:

To choose a customer parameter to search by (for example, **Name** or **Member Code**), tap the preferred parameter above the search field. 

To scan a customer's membership code with the device camera, tap **Scan** ({{% inum "B" %}} in the screenshot above).
{{% notice info %}}
If the customer self-registered at your store on the same day, you can find the required customer record in the **RECENT CUSTOMERS** list. To open the list, tap **Show Recent Customers** below the search field.
{{% /notice %}}
Alternatively, to add a new customer, at the bottom, tap **Create New Customer** ({{% inum "C" %}} in the screenshot above).

3. Tap the **Cart** tab at the top.  
To add an item to the sale, do one of the following:
    - tap the **barcode** icon next to the **Item Search** field ({{% inum "A" %}} in the screenshot below) and then scan the item
    - scan the item with the connected RFID reader
    - use the **Item Search** field in the right-side panel. If an exact match is found, the item is added immediately. If multiple matching results are found, tap the required row to add that item to the sale

To edit an item that's been added (for example, to add a discount or a fee), swipe the item row left and then tap **Edit** {{% inum "B" %}}.

4. To add or change a cashier or associate on the sale, in the right-side panel under the **Item** **Search** field, tap **Cashier** or **Associate**, respectively.

5. To put the Sales Receipt on hold (save without finalizing), tap **Hold** in the upper right corner.

5. Tap **Pay** ({{% inum "C" %}} in the screenshot above) to proceed to the **Payment** area.
