The **Start of Day** (SOD) process allows for counting cash at the store opening as well as recording any discrepancies with the closing count of the previous Drawer Memo.

To create a new Drawer Memo and start the SOD process, in POS:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **Start new Drawer Memo**. Note that, if there is an inactive Drawer Memo, it's required to finalize the latter via the End of Day process before starting a new Memo.

Please be advised that the look of the **Start of Day** area depends on your CHQ settings.

To complete the SOD process, you have to go through each tab displayed on the left.  

a. On the **Drawer Cash -- Opening Count** tab ({{% inum "A" %}} in the screenshot below), in the **Count** {{% inum "B" %}} column of the grid, enter the present number of bills or coins for each denomination. Tap **Next** at the bottom-right {{% inum "C" %}}.

If the **Previous Diff** column has a non-zero value, on tapping **Next**, you will be asked to create a cash movement record to handle that difference.

Also, if foreign currencies are set up, a separate **Opening Count** tab is available for each currency. The same actions as described above must be performed on each **Opening Count** tab.

b. On the **Safe Cash -- Opening Count** tab (if applicable), in the **Opening** **Amount** field, enter the current amount in the safe. Tap **Next**.

c. In **Complete -- Summary**, to automatically print the Memo on finalizing, turn the **Print Start of Day** switch on.  
If the **Notes** field is required, tap **Add Notes**.  

3. Tap **Complete** to finish the SOD process and activate the Memo.
