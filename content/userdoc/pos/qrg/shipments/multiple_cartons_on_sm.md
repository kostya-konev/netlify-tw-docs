In POS PRO, you can pack a ship order in several cartons. For example, you may want to do so when shipping several large items and putting them in separate packages. 

To indicate that you're using several packages, when processing the Ship Memo, distribute ship items between respective cartons. To do so, in POS PRO:

1. On the Home Screen, tap **Shipments**. Depending on your custom settings, the **Shipments** button may be located in the navigation bar at the bottom or in the **More** menu. 

2. In **Shipments**, tap the **Outgoing** tab at the top.

3. In **Outgoing**, find and tap the required Ship Memo.

4. Tap **Items** at the top:

On the tab, process ship items as required.

5. Tap **Cartons** at the top. 

6. Tap **Carton [number]** at the top-right. In the list of options that opens, tap **Add Carton** as required. For example, if 3 cartons are required on the shipment, tap **Add Carton** two times (one carton is always available by default).

7. Once cartons are added, at the top-right, tap **Carton [number]** {{% inum "A" %}} and select the carton you want to pack, for example, Carton 1:
{{% gimg src="V6.38 QRG/638_qrg_1.png" width="600px" %}}
Then, in the items grid, tap **Pack** {{% inum "B" %}} next to all the item units that go into Carton 1. 

8. Repeat **step 7** for all the cartons. 

9. Tap the **Shipment** tab at the top-right. 

10. On the **Shipment** tab, under **SELECT CARTON**, tap a **Carton [number]** {{% inum "1" %}}:
{{% gimg src="V6.38 QRG/638_qrg_2.png" width="600px" %}}
In the dialog that opens, configure shipment-related functions for that carton and then save the dialog. 

11. Repeat **step 10** for all the cartons.

12. Back in the **Outgoing â€“ Ship Memo** area, tap **SAVE** at the bottom-right.
