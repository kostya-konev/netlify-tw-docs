Purchase Return (RET) is used to remove items from inventory for shipment back to the vendor.

To create a Purchase Return, in POS PRO:

1. Tap **Shipments** in the app's **Home Screen** navigation panel or in the fly-out **More** menu (the location of the button is defined by your custom settings).

2. In **Shipments**, tap **Outgoing** at the top of the screen.

3. In **Outgoing**, tap **New Outgoing**:

4. In the **New Outgoing** dialog that opens, select **Purchase Return** in the **Type** field. Then, select the vendor and tap **Create** in the upper right corner:

5. Once the Purchase Return has been created, its **Document** tab will display. In that tab, indicate the required ship method and tracking number.

6. Tap **Items** at the top-right of the screen:

7. Initially, the **Items** tab contains no items. There are two ways you can add items to the list:

    - scan the item's barcode (preferred)
    - in the **Item Search** field, enter the item's UPC, PLU, CLU, or your item's description

8. You can scan each item (multiple quantities), or once an item has been added, you can manually configure its **Return Qty**. To do so, swipe the required item row left and tap **Edit**:

9. If necessary to print a Purchase Receipt or tags for all items, tap **Print** in the upper right corner.

10. Also, to automatically print any of the above on finalizing, turn the **Print on Finalize** switch on:

11. Tap **Finalize**.
