A Store Pickup Ship Memo instructs a store to prepare an order that a customer will pick up. Ship Memos that have been assigned to your location appear under `Shipments > Outgoing` in the `Prepare Pick Up` status. 

To prepare a customer's order for pickup, in POS PRO:

1. On the Home Screen, tap **Shipments**. Depending on your custom settings, the button can be located in the navigation bar at the bottom or in the **More** menu.

2. On the **Outgoing** tab, find the required Ship Memo and tap to open it.

3. In the **Outgoing â€“ Ship Memo** area that opens, at the top, tap **Items**.

On the **Items** tab, you can see the list of items that need to be prepared. For each item, the following columns are available:

- **Memo Qty**: quantity requested for the pickup order. Not editable
- **Avail Qty**: quantity your location can prepare. Editable
- **Unavail Qty**: quantity your location is unable to prepare (for example, the requested item is damaged). Editable

To finalize the Ship Memo, you need to allocate each item quantity to **Avail Qty**, **Unavail Qty**, or a combination of both.

4. Change the status of items you are preparing to `Available`. You can do so in one of the following ways:

    - To quickly set all items to `Available`, at the top-right, tap **All Available** {{% inum "A" %}}.  
    - To set an item line to `Available`, swipe that item left and then tap **Available** {{% inum "B" %}}.  
    - To increment an item's **Avail Qty** by `1`, scan that item with your RFID reader or search manually via the **Search** field.  
    - To set a specific item quantity to `Available` (for example, 2 out of 3 requested units), swipe that item left and then tap **Edit** {{% inum "C" %}}. In the dialog that opens, define the **Available Quantity** field.  

5. If you cannot prepare some items, change their status to `Unavailable`. You can do so in one of the following ways:

    - To quickly set all items to `Unavailable`, at the top-right, tap **All Unavailable**. In the pop-up menu that appears, select a reject reason. 
    - To set an item line to `Unavailable`, swipe that item left and then tap **Unavailable**. In the pop-up menu that appears, select a reject reason. 
    - To set a specific item quantity to `Unavailable`, swipe that item left and then tap **Edit**. In the dialog that opens, define the **Unavailable Quantity** and **Rejected Reason** fields.

6. Tap **SAVE**. On tapping, the Ship Memo changes status from `Prepare Pick Up` to `Pick Up Ready`. At that point, a notification is sent to the customer's email.

If some of the items or item units were marked as unavailable, on saving, the Ship Memo is reissued. The new Ship Memo (appears under `Shipments > Outgoing`) will contain only item quantities that were marked as available. In case of reissue, the store associate should continue with the new Ship Memo.
