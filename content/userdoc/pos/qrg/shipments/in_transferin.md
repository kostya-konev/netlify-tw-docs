Transfer In is used to receive items sent from another location. To update your location quantities, it is required to finalize a Transfer In.

To do so, in POS Pro:

1. Tap **Shipments** in the app's **Home Screen** navigation panel or in the fly-out **More** menu (the location of the button is defined by your custom settings).

2. In **Shipments**, tap **Incoming** at the top of the screen.

3. In the **Incoming** tab, find the required Transfer In (T-IN) and tap to open it.  
If the Transfer In has a carton number, scan it or enter in the search field to find an exact match. Alternatively, scan or enter the number of the associated Transfer Order to see all the Transfers In related to it.

4. Tap **Items** at the top-right of the screen. Tapping **Items** will open the list of merchandise that has arrived from another location.  
For each item on the list, the **Pack Qty** column displays what the other location has sent to you.

5. Then, you need to receive the items. To do so, perform one of the following:

- In the **Item Search** field {{% inum "A" %}} enter the item's UPC, PLU, or ALU

- Scan the item's barcode {{% inum "B" %}}
Receiving the item using any of the above methods will increase that item's **In Qty** value by 1.

Alternatively, to receive all the Transfer In items at once, tap the **Receive All** button {{% inum "C" %}}. Tapping the button will automatically match the values of **Pack Qty** and **In Qty**.

Also, it is possible to change the item's **In Qty** manually. To do so, swipe the item row left and tap **Edit** {{% inum "D" %}}. In the **Edit** dialog that opens, change the **In Qty** value and tap **Save** in the top right corner:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image15.png" width="400px" %}}

6. Tap **Finalize** to update the quantities at your location.
