In POS PRO, it is possible to print a ticket for an item without saving the whole document. The ticket can contain important information about the item, for example if it is damaged.

It is possible to print item tickets in the following documents:

- Transfer Out, Transfer Order, Transfer In

- Purchase Receipt, Purchase Return, Purchase Order

- ASN

- Adjustment Memo

To print an item ticket:

1. Open the required document in **Shipments** or **Adjustments**.

2. In the document, tap **Items** at the top.

3. In **Items**, swipe left the required item row. Then, tap **Print Ticket** {{% inum "A" %}}:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image53.png" width="700px" %}}
Alternatively, to add notes to the item ticket, swipe left the item row and then tap **Edit**. In the **Edit** dialog, fill out the **Notes** field and then tap **Print Ticket**:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image54.png" width="400px" %}}

#### Additionally

To configure default settings for printing an item ticket, in **Shipments** or **Adjustments**, tap **Print Options**:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image55.png" width="400px" %}}
In the **Printing Options** dialog that opens, choose the required type of ticket (**Transfer Item Ticket**, **Purchasing Item Ticket**, or **Adjustment Item Ticket**) and configure the settings.
