A Ship to Store (STS) Ship Memo is created when a customer wants to pick up an order in store but the preferred store doesn't have the required item(s) in stock. 

To allow for order fulfillment, a transfer is created along with the Ship Memo. The transfer delivers items to the store chosen by the customer, and then the store fulfills the Ship Memo.

To process an STS Ship Memo, in POS PRO:
{{% notice note %}}
Before processing the Ship Memo, the store associate should process the associated Transfer In (for details on how to process a Transfer In, see [Incoming: Transfer In](https://twdocs.netlify.app/userdoc/pos/qrg/shipments/in_transferin/)). The number and status of the linked Transfer Order is available under `Shipments > Outgoing > [your STS Ship Memo] > Info tab` in the **Transfer Order** field.  
Finalizing the associated Transfer In changes the status of the STS Ship Memo to `Pick Up Ready` and notifies the customer to pick up the order.

    - To set a specific item quantity to `Picked Up` (for example, 2 out of 3 requested units), swipe that item left and then tap **Edit**. In the dialog that opens, define the **Picked Up Quantity** field. 

5. If the customer rejected some items or the order was never picked up, set the status of those items to `Rejected`. You can do so by doing one of the following:
