Transfer Out contains items that your store is sending to another location. In POS PRO, it is possible to create a Transfer Out without a Transfer Order.

To do so, in POS PRO:

1. Tap **Shipments** in the app's **Home Screen** navigation panel or in the fly-out **More** menu (the location of the button is defined by your custom settings).

2. In the **Outgoing** tab, tap **New Outgoing**:

3. In the **New Outgoing** dialog that opens, define the target location and tap **Create** in the upper right corner.

4. Once the Transfer Out has been created, its **Document** tab will display. In that tab, indicate:

    - transfer reason
    - ship method
    - tracking number

5. Tap **Items** to open the **Items** tab:

Initially, the **Items** tab contains no items. There are two ways you can add items to the list:

    - scan the item's barcode (preferred)
    - enter the item's UPC, PLU, CLU, or your item's description in the **Item Search** field

6. You can scan each item (multiple quantities), or once an item has been added, you can manually configure its **Out Qty**. To do so, swipe the required item row left and tap **Edit**:

7. If necessary, to print tags for all items or a mailing label, tap **Print** in the upper right corner of the screen.  
Also, to automatically print a transfer memo on finalizing, turn the **Print on Finalize** switch on.

8. To save the Transfer Out without finalization, tap **Hold** in the upper right corner. On tapping, the Transfer Memo Out is automatically sent to the email address defined for that location in CHQ.

9. Tap **Finalize**.
