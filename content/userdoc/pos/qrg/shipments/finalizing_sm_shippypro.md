ShippyPro is a shipping software that allows retailers to ship, track, and manage returns for their orders.

In Teamwork POS, integration with ShippyPro allows users to quickly create shipping labels based on the submitted shipping details.

To finalize a Ship Memo with ShippyPro:

1. On the Home Screen, tap **Shipments**. Depending on your custom settings, the button can be located in the navigation bar at the bottom or in the **More** menu.

2. Once the **Outgoing** area of **Shipments** is open, find and tap the required Ship Memo.

3. On the **Items** tab of the Ship Memo, process ship items as required.

4. On the **Cartons** tab, assign items to carton(s).

3. Then, on the **Shipment** tab, under **SELECT CARTON**, tap the **Carton [number]** you want to configure.  
In the **Shipment â€“ Carton [number]** area that opens:
{{% gimg src="V6.39 QRG/639_qrg_8.jpg" width="500px" %}}

    a. To select the weight units in which the weight of the package will be defined, tap **Options** {{% inum "A" %}}.

    b. Enter the weight and size of your package in the **Weight** and **Dimensions** fields respectively  (**required**) {{% inum "B" %}}. 
    Alternatively, to automatically fill out **Dimensions**, tap the required label of a default box size {{% inum "C" %}}.

    c. To print the shipping label, next to the **Get Label** button, turn on the **Print Label** switch.

    d. Then, tap **Get Label** {{% inum "D" %}}. On tapping, both shipping label and return shipping label are retrieved. On retrieving, in the **Label Preview** section, a preview of the shipping label displays.

    e. To void labels and edit the **Weight** and **Dimensions** fields again, tap **Void Labels** in the **Tracking \#** field.

    f. Once finished, tap **Done**/**Print** in the upper right corner.

4. Back on the **Shipment** tab, repeat **step 3** for all cartons.

5. To configure printing settings for shipment documents, in the top-right corner, tap **Print**. Additionally, to automatically print configured documents when the Ship Memo is finalized, at the bottom, turn the **Print on Save** switch on.

5. Tap **SAVE** to finalize.
