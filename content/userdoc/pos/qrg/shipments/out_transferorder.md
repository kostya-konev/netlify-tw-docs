Transfer Order is a **request** to your location to send out inventory to another location. To confirm changes in item quantities and finish processing a Transfer Order, you will need to finalize it.

To do so, in POS Pro:

1. Tap **Shipments** in the app's **Home Screen** navigation panel or in the fly-out **More** menu (the location of the button is defined by your custom settings).

2. In the **Shipments** area, tap **Outgoing** at the top of the screen.

3. In the **Outgoing** tab, find the required Transfer Order (TO) and tap to open it.

4. In the **Document** tab of the Transfer Order:

    - select a transfer reason (required)
    - select a ship method (required)
    - enter the tracking number of your transfer (required)

5. Then, tap **Items** located at the top right of the screen.

6. Tapping **Items** will display the list of items that are to be sent out to another location.

In **Items**, you can do the following:

- Tap **Transfer All** to include all the Transfer Order quantities (**Out Qty** will equal **Ord Qty** for each item)

- Tap **Reject All** if you are unable to transfer any items (**Rej Qty** will equal **Ord Qty** for each item)

Quantity modifications are available for individual items as well. Scan in your item or enter the item's UPC, PLU, or ALU into the **Item Search** field. If the item is found, the item's **Out Qt*y*** value will be increased by 1.

Also, it is possible to swipe the item row left and change **Out Qty**, **Reject Qty**, and **Reject Reason**. Once done, tap **Save** in the **Edit** dialog.

6. Tap **Finalize**.
