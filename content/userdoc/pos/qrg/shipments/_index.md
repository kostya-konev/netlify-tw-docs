In the **Shipments** area of POS, you can manage your store's incoming (for example, Purchase Receipts, ASNs, etc.) and outgoing (for example, Ship Memos, Transfer Orders, Purchase Returns, etc.) documents.

1. To open the area, on the iPad POS app's **Home Screen**, tap the **Shipments** button. According to your custom settings, it can be located:

    - in the navigation panel at the bottom
    - in the fly-out menu that opens on tapping **More**

The badge app icon (red circle) next to the **Shipments** button shows a total of outgoing and incoming documents that require your attention.

Once the **Shipments** button is tapped, the documents will appear in the **Shipments** area.

The **Shipments** area consists of three tabs:

a.  ***Outgoing*:** contains documents with items that go out from your location

b.  ***Incoming*:** contains documents with items that your store is receiving

c.  ***History*:** contains both incoming and outgoing documents that are finalized

2. To refresh the information in any of the above tabs, pull the page down.

3. To configure a document's default printing options, tap **Print Options** in the upper right corner of the screen. The settings are configured for a specific document type.

4. To search for documents, use the **Search** field in the upper left corner. You can manually enter **Document \#**, **Order \#**, or any other descriptive element to identify the document. Alternatively, it is possible to use the device camera or scanner.

5. Filtering is available in the **History** tab. By default, the documents that were created within the last 30 days are displayed.  
To change the time span, tap **Filter** next to the **Search** field.
6. If you've opened a document in **Shipments** and need to put down your device for a while, you can **lock the screen**.  
To do so, when viewing any document, tap **Lock Screen**:

On tapping, you'll be logged out, while the document will remain open. When you return, just log back in and you will be brought back to wherever you left in the document.
