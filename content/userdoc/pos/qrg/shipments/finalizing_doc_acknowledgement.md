In POS PRO, finalizing certain documents may require entering your credentials (manager override) and/or capturing your signature. Such documents include:

- Transfer Order, Transfer In, Transfer Out
- Purchase Order, Purchase Receipt, Purchase Return
- Adjustment Memo

To finalize a document when acknowledgement is required:

1. Tap **Finalize** or **Post** in the document (depending on your document type). On tapping, the **Acknowledgement** dialog with several acknowledgement statements displays:

2. Select the required statement and tap **Continue** in the upper right corner of the dialog.

3. Then, if manager override is required, the **Manager Override** dialog displays. In the dialog, enter your username and password and then tap **Log In**.  
Please note that to perform the manager override, you must be granted with the **Allowed to acknowledge transaction** right.

4. If capturing signature is required, the dialog for drawing a signature displays next:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image44.png" width="500px" %}}
In the dialog, draw your signature in the blank space.

5. Once done, tap **Accept Signature** at the bottom of the dialog. Alternatively, tap **Clear Signature** to start the signature over.
