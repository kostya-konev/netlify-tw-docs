A Ship to Customer (STC) Ship Memo requests shipment of items from your store/warehouse to a customer's address. The Ship Memo specifies items and quantity to ship as well as other details. 

Ship Memos that have been assigned to your location appear under `Shipments > Outgoing`. 

To process an STC Ship Memo, in POS PRO:

1. On the Home Screen, tap **Shipments**. Depending on your custom settings, the button can be located in the navigation bar at the bottom or in the **More** menu.

2. On the **Outgoing** tab, find the required Ship Memo and tap to open it.

3. In the **Outgoing â€“ Ship Memo** area that opens, at the top, tap **Items**. 
{{% notice tip %}}
On the **Items** tab, you can see the list of items that need to be shipped. For each item, the following columns are available:

- **Memo Qty**: quantity requested for shipping. Not editable
- **Ship Qty**: quantity your location is shipping. Editable
- **Rej Qty**: quantity your location is unable to ship (for example, the requested item is damaged). Editable

To finalize the Ship Memo, you need to allocate each item quantity to **Ship Qty**, **Rej Qty**, or a combination of both.

    - To quickly set all items to `Ship`, at the top-right, tap **Ship All** {{% inum "A" %}}.  
    - To set an item line to `Ship`, swipe that item left and then tap **Ship** {{% inum "B" %}}.  
    - To increment an item's **Ship Qty** by `1`, scan that item with your RFID reader or search manually via the **Search** field.  
    - To set a specific item quantity to `Ship` (for example, 2 out of 3 requested units), swipe that item left and then tap **Edit** {{% inum "C" %}}. In the dialog that opens, define the **Shipped Quantity** field.  

5. If you cannot ship some items, change their status to `Rejected`. You can do so in one of the following ways:

    - To quickly set all items to `Rejected`, at the top-right, tap **Reject All**. In the pop-up menu that appears, select a reject reason.

6. At the top, tap the **Cartons** tab. On this tab, you can distribute items between multiple cartons or pack all in a single carton.
