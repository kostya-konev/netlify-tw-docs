In POS PRO, it's possible to search for, edit, and print multiple item tags from the **Catalog** area. 

To do so, in POS PRO:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **Catalog**. Depending on your custom settings, the **Catalog** button can be located in the navigation panel at the bottom {{% inum "A" %}} or in the **More** menu {{% inum "B" %}}:

2. In the **Catalog** area, tap **Print Tags** in the upper right corner.

3. Once the **Print Tags** area opens, add items by doing one of the following:
    - scan the items with your RFID reader
    - use the **Search** field at the top for manual entry {{% inum "1" %}}
    - tap **Scan** next to the **Search** field to scan the items with the device camera {{% inum "2" %}}

4. After the items are added, to change the number of tags to print for an item, tap the **Quantity** column for the required item {{% inum "A" %}}:
{{% gimg src="V6.40 QRG/6.40_qrg_2.jpg" width="600px" %}}
Additionally, to change the item price to be printed on the tag, tap the **Tag Price** column {{% inum "B" %}}.

5. Tap **PRINT TAGS** at the bottom-right.

5. In the **Print Tags** dialog that opens, select a printer, document template, and the place on the sheet where the first tag will be printed (**Start Position on Sheet**).

6. Tap **Print** in the upper right corner.

Printing multiple tags is also possible from the following documents:

- Transfer Order, Transfer In, Transfer Out
- Purchase Order, Purchase Receipt
- Adjustment Memo

When the **Print Tags** area is opened from one of these documents, all items from the document are added automatically, meaning no item lookup is required.
