The information on item quantities that are available for the whole company can be found in the **Availability** area of POS Pro. To access the area:

1. Tap **Catalog** in the app's **Home Screen** navigation panel or in the fly-out **More** menu (the location of the button is defined by your custom settings). Tapping **Catalog** opens the **Item Search** screen.

2. Search for the required item.
There are two ways you can search for an item:  
a. In the **Item Search** field, enter the item's UPC, PLU, CLU, or your item's description:

b. Tap the **barcode scanning** icon to scan the item's tag:
{{% gimg src="QRG_main/image4.png" width="250px" %}} 
Once the input has been made, the items matching the search criteria will display. You can sort to find the required item by tapping any of the columns' headers.

3. Tap the required item to open the **Availability** (Real Time Availability, or RTA) view. On initial opening, the top grid in **Availability** displays quantities for the initialized location.  
To see item quantities for the whole company, in the **LOCATION** list at the bottom, tap **Get Other Locations**:

Once the list of all store locations appears, tap the **Company** row.

#### Additionally

- From **Availability**, you can **print tags**.  
To do so, tap **Print Tag** in the top right corner of the screen. In the **Print Tags** dialog that opens, you can configure printing settings. It is possible to select a printer, choose a template for your tag as well as specify the number of copies you want to print.
Having configured the settings, tap **Print**.

- In **Availability**, you can **change the default name of the columns**.  
To do so, tap **Options** in the upper right corner of the view. Then, in the **Options** dialog that opens, select the column's alias. Tap **Done** for the changes to take place.
