The information on item quantities that are available for other locations can be found in the **Availability** area of POS Pro. To access the area:

1. Tap **Catalog** in the app's **Home Screen** navigation panel or in the fly-out **More** menu (the location of the button is defined by your custom settings). Tapping **Catalog** opens the **Item Search** screen.
2. Search for the required item by manually entering your item's UPC, PLU, CLU, or any part of the item's description in the **Item Search** field.  
Alternatively, tap the **barcode scanning** icon next to the **Item Search** field and scan your item's tag:

Once the input has been made, the items matching the search criteria will display. You can sort to find the required item by tapping columns' headers.

4. Tap the required item to open the **Availability** (Real Time Availability, or RTA) view. On initial opening, the top grid in **Availability** displays quantities for the initialized location.

5. To see item quantities for the whole company, in the **LOCATION** list at the bottom, tap **Get Other Locations**:

On tapping, all available store locations appear in the list. To search for a store location by **location code** or **location name**, tap **Location Search**:

For a location's available quantities to be displayed in the top grid, tap the required location in the list.  
To hide the **LOCATION** list, tap the **arrow** button in the upper right corner of the grid:
