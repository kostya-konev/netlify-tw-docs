In each customer profile in POS PRO, it is possible to indicate the following:

- if the customer agreed to receive information via the phone, email, or mail
- if the customer's mobile phone and postal address are valid
- if the customer's loyalty points are converted to rewards

To do so, in POS:

1. On **Home Screen**, tap **Customer** in the navigation panel at the bottom or in the **More** menu. On tapping, the **Customer** main page opens.

2. In the **Customer** main page, search for the required profile via the **Customer Search** field.

3. In the list of search results, tap the row with the required customer. On tapping, the customer's full profile opens.

To indicate that the customer allowed calling or sending texts on their phone number, turn on the **Calls** or **SMS** switch next to the required phone number.

To indicate if the customer's mobile phone is valid, configure the **Validated** field next to the switches.
