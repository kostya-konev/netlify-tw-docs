2. To search for customers, use the search field at the top {{% inum "A" %}}:

To define by which customer field to search, tap the preferred search parameter above the search field {{% inum "B" %}}.  
Alternatively, tap **Scan** {{% inum "B" %}} to scan the customer's member code.

3. In the list of search results, tap the required row.   
Tapping anywhere in the row except for the **See More** option opens full customer record in the edit mode; tapping **See More** opens the **Customer Preview** dialog where you can see basic customer information:

    - open the record in the edit mode by tapping **EDIT** {{% inum "1" %}}
    - view the customer's **Purchase History** {{% inum "2" %}}
    - start a new sale with this customer by tapping **Add to Sale** {{% inum "3" %}}
