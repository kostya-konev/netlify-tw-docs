If you are running POS PRO for the first time or you have logged out, you will need to **log in**.

To do so, in POS PRO:

1. Find and then tap your username.

2. Enter your password and tap **Log In**.  
Alternatively, you can type in your username and password in the corresponding fields and then tap **Log In**.

3. Tapping **Log In** will open the app's **Home Screen**:

To open a POS area (for example, **Catalog** or **Shipments**), tap the required button in the navigation panel at the bottom of the screen.

Alternatively, tap **More** in the bottom right corner. In the fly-out menu that opens, tap the required area. 

Additionally, in the fly-out **More** menu, it is possible to:

- add or change your photo

- update your password

- open the POS **Settings** area

To log out of your user profile, tap **Log Out** in the upper left corner.
