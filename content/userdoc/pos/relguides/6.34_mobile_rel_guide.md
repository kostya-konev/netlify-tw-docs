## Feature Descriptions

### Shipping items to the customer and managing store pickups

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-2780, PRO-6239`

With this update, it is now possible to:

- ship a sale item to the customer
- prepare a sale item for store pickup

#### Purpose

A **Ship to Customer** is a type of sale where the customer purchases goods in a store and requests for the purchase to be shipped to a specific address. Shipping may also be useful when certain merchandise is out of stock, and the store arranges for the latter to be shipped from the warehouse directly to the customer.

A **Store Pickup** is a type of sale where the customer picks up purchased goods at a store. The pickup order is filled from the store's inventory, or the neccessary items may be transferred to the store and then held for customer pickup.

#### Shipping an item to the customer

To ship an item to the customer on sale finalization, in POS Pro:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **New Sale**.

2. In the **Sales Receipt** area, add sale items and a customer to the receipt.
{{% notice note %}}
Adding a customer is required for shipping. If a customer is not added, the **Ship** tab of the **[item name] - edit** dialog will be blank.

6. In the **Ship To Address** dialog that displays, tap the address the item must be shipped to.  
Additionally, in the **Ship to Address** dialog, you can do the following:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_3.png" width="350px"%}}
    - switch between the **Ship To**, **Bill To**, and **Postal** tabs {{% inum "1" %}} to view all the addresses available on the customer's record
    - tap **Edit** next to an address to edit it {{% inum "2" %}}
    - tap **Add New Address** at the bottom {{% inum "3" %}} to add a new address record. After the sale is finalized, the new address can be automatically added to the customer's record
7. Once the ship-to address is defined, back in the **Ship** tab, configure the following fields:
**Field**|**Description**|**Value**|
:----------- | :----------- |:----------- |
**Ship Method**|The shipping method used to deliver the item to the customer.| If no value is set by default, the **Select** button allows for choosing among available ship methods. {{% notice note %}} 
To be available for selection in the **Ship Method** field, in CHQ, the ship method must be marked as **available for POS ship item**. The **available for POS ship item** checkbox is available under `settings > company settings > shipping methods > [selected ship method]`.
{{% /notice %}} Alternatively, the following default values may be set: <ul><li>the default ship method from the customer's record, or</li></ul><ul><li>if no ship method is available in the customer's record, the company's default ship method (`chq > settings > company settings > shipping methods`).</li></ul>|

In this case, the goods will be shipped from the fill location directly to the customer.|The **Select** button allows for choosing a fill location.  {{% notice info %}} 
The availability and behavior of the **Fill From** and **Lock Fill From** fields are controlled by the **send sale - lock fill location** setting located under `chq > settings > order management > customer orders`. For the **send sale - lock fill location** setting, the following values are available:

- `always`: the **Fill From** field is visible in POS Pro. If the user defines a fill location, the Order Management System (OMS) does not override the user's choice
- `ok`: both **Fill From** and **Lock Fill From** fields are visible in POS Pro. If the **Lock Fill From** switch is turned on, the order must be filled at the location defined in the **Fill From** field. If the **Lock Fill From** switch is turned off, and the order can't be filled at the defined location, OMS will automatically assign another fill location
- `never`: neither **Fill From** nor **Lock Fill From** fields are visible in POS Pro. OMS assigns a fill location automatically

### Drawer Memo: Performing midday counts of cash and masking "expected" amounts

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-6191`

The **Drawer Memo** area of POS Pro was updated with the following capabilities:

- performing midday counts of cash in the drawer
- masking values in the "expected amount" fields showing what should be in the drawer with `****`

#### Purpose

Midday counts allow for checking drawer balance during the day and ensuring there are no discrepancies. Additionally, if no cash payments were made after a midday count, the latter can be used as the end-of-day count to speed up the store closing procedures.  
Note that midday counts can be performed multiple times throughout the day but are not a requirement for finalizing the Drawer Memo.

Masking expected amounts may be useful for preventing store associates from simply copying the expected amount when counting money in the drawer. That would ensure no discrepancies are present and the cash is properly counted.

#### Performing a midday count of the drawer cash

To perform a midday count, in POS Pro:

1. On the **Home Screen**, in the right-side panel, tap **View** in the **DRAWER MEMO** section {{% inum "1" %}}:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_22.png" width="700px"%}}

2. Tap **Midday Count** at the bottom-right {{% inum "1" %}}:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_23.png" width="700px"%}}
Please note that, in the **Drawer Memo** area, the time and date of the last midday count are available in the left-side panel {{% inum "2" %}}. In the right side-panel, the **Last Midday Over/Short** amount is shown {{% inum "3" %}}. 

3. In the **Midday Count** area, tap **New Count**:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_24.png" width="700px"%}}
If foreign currencies are available, in the pop-over dialog that appears, select the currency that should be counted.

4. In the **Drawer Cash â€“ Midday Count** area that opens, tap **Open Drawer** at the bottom {{% inum "1" %}} and count the cash:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_25.png" width="700px"%}}
After counting:
    - if applicable, in the denomination grid, enter the number of counted bills and coins in the **Count** column {{% inum "2" %}}, or
    - enter the counted total in the **Midday Amount** field {{% inum "3" %}}
{{% notice info %}}
To define if the denomination grid is shown and required for midday counts, under `chq > settings > drawer management > drawer memo settings`, configure the **denomination entry on midday count** field.
{{% /notice %}}

5. Tap **Next** at the bottom-right.

6. In the **COMPLETE â€“ Summary** area, review the details of your count and then tap **Save** at the bottom-right.

#### Masking expected amounts for drawer cash

{{% notice info %}}
To enable masking of expected amounts in POS Pro, in CHQ under `settings > drawer management > drawer memo settings`, select the **mask expected amount totals** checkbox.
{{% /notice %}}

When masking is turned on, certain values in the Drawer Memo related areas are replaced with `****`.

Under `Drawer Memo > Start of Day`, the following values will be hidden:

- on the **Drawer Cash â€“ Opening Count** tab:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_9.png" width="700px"%}}

- on the **COMPLETE â€“ Summary** tab:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_10.png" width="700px"%}}

Under `Drawer Memo > End of Day`, the following values will be hidden:

- on the **Drawer Cash â€“ Closing Count** tab:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_11.png" width="700px"%}}

- on the **Drawer Cash â€“ Summary** tab:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_12.png" width="700px"%}}

Under `Drawer Memo > Midday Count`, the following values will be hidden:

- on the **Drawer Cash â€“ Midday Count** tab:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_13.png" width="700px"%}}

- on the **COMPLETE â€“ Summary** tab:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_14.png" width="700px"%}}

##### Notifying when the counted amount doesn't match the expected amount

When an expected amount is hidden, users will be notified when entering a counted amount that doesn't match the expected amount. In particular, that applies to the following fields:

- **Opening Amount** under `Drawer Memo > Start of Day > Drawer Cash â€“ Opening Count`
- **Closing Count** under `Drawer Memo > End of Day > Drawer Cash â€“ Closing Count`
- **Midday Amount** under `Drawer Memo > Midday Count > Drawer Cash â€“ Midday Count`

When the expected and counted amounts don't match, the **Not the Expected Amount** dialog appears:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_15.png" width="250px"%}}
Tapping **Recount** allows for recounting and entering another amount.  
Alternatively, it's possible to proceed with the entered amount by tapping **Continue Anyway**.

### Drawer Memo: Cash drop notifications

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-683`

We've added the capability to notify users when a cash drop from the store's drawer or safe is recommended or required by configuring cash drop thresholds.

#### Purpose

The new feature allows retailers to keep track of balance in the store's drawer(s) and safe. By setting thresholds, it's now possible to define at which point money should be moved from the drawer to the safe or deposited at the bank before accepting new payments is possible.

Users can set thresholds for both recommended and required cash drops. 

#### Configuration in CHQ

In CHQ, configuring the thresholds for cash drop is possible:

- at the company level under `settings > drawer management > drawer memo settings >` the `pos` section
- at the location level under `settings > location settings > locations / location settings > [selected location] > sales >` the `cash drawer` section. To prioritize the location-level settings over the company-level settings, the **use location based cash drop** checkbox must be selected

#### Cash drop notifications for drawer cash

POS Pro notifies the user about a recommended or required cash drop from the drawer when:

- the user starts a new sale
- at the time of sale, the user selects the Cash payment method

The user will also see a notification when the **Opening Amount** value under `Drawer Memo > Start of Day > Drawer Cash â€“ Opening Count` or **Next Day Float Amount** value under `Drawer Memo > End of Day > Drawer Cash â€“ Next Drawer Float` exceeds the thresholds for the drawer cash.

##### Notifications on starting a new sale
<a name="notifications-on-starting-a-new-sale"></a>
When the user starts a new sale, the following notification dialogs can now appear:

- the `A cash drop is recommended` dialog appears when the threshold for cash drop warning is reached:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_26.png" width="300px"%}}
    - To create a new Deposit or Move to Safe record, tap **Make Deposit** or **Move to Safe** respectively.  
    - To continue processing the sale, tap **Continue to New Sale**.
{{% notice note %}}
For the **Move to Safe** option to be available, in CHQ, the **safe management** checkbox must be selected under `services > device controller > [selected device] > general`. 
{{% /notice %}}

- the `A cash drop is required` dialog appears when the threshold for cash drop requirement is reached:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_27.png" width="300px"%}}
    - To create a new Deposit or Move to Safe record, tap **Make Deposit** or **Move to Safe** respectively.  
    - To continue processing the sale, tap **Continue to New Sale**. If the Cash payment method is selected at the time of sale, the notification dialog will appear again.

##### Notifications on selecting the Cash payment method

When at the time of sale the user selects the Cash payment method, the following notifications dialog can appear:

- the `A cash drop is recommended` dialog as described in [Notifications on starting a new sale](#notifications-on-starting-a-new-sale)
- the `A cash drop is required` dialog appears when the threshold for cash drop requirement is reached:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_28.png" width="300px"%}}
    - To create a new Deposit or Move to Safe record, tap **Make Deposit** or **Move to Safe** respectively.  
    - To choose another payment method, tap **Select Other Payment Method**.  
    - If the user has the **Sales Receipts â€“ Bypass required cash drop** security right, to finalize the cash payment, tap **Continue with Cash Payment**. If the user doesn't have that right, on tapping **Continue with Cash Payment**, manager override is required.

##### Notifications in the Drawer Memo area

Under `Drawer Memo > Start of Day` and `Drawer Memo > End of Day`, the user is now warned when there is a drawer amount that exceeds the configured threshold. 

In particular, the **Drawer Cash Threshold** dialog appears when:

- under `Drawer Memo > Start of Day > Drawer Cash â€“ Opening Count`, the **Opening Amount** value exceeds the threshold, and the user taps **Next**
- under `Drawer Memo > End of Day > Drawer Cash â€“ Next Drawer Float`, the **Next Day Float Amount** value exceeds the threshold, and the user taps **Next**

In the dialog, it's possible to:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_29.png" width="250px"%}}
- Tap **Change Amount** to remain in the area and change the amount.
- Tap **Continue** to proceed to the next area with the configured amount.

#### Cash drop notifications for safe cash

### Sales Receipt: Notifying users when the discount requires a customer assigned

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-5974`

POS Pro now notifies users when the applied discount requires a customer on the Sales Receipt. 

#### Configuration in CHQ

To define if a discount requires a customer assigned to the sale, under `chq > settings > sales > discount reasons > [selected discount reason] > general`, configure the **require customer** checkbox.

#### Notifications about a discount requiring a customer

Now, in the **Sales Receipt** area of POS Pro, when the user tries to apply a discount that requires a customer, and there is no customer record on the sale, the **Customer Required** dialog appears:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_4.png" width="250px"%}}
{{% notice note %}}
Please note that, after tapping **Okay**, the discount will NOT be applied. Once the customer is added, it's required to apply the discount again.
{{% /notice %}}
Also, if a discount that requires a customer is applied to the sale, and the user tries to remove the customer, the following **Customer Required** dialog appears:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_5.png" width="250px"%}}
Tapping **Remove Discount** removes both the customer and the discount from the sale.

### Logging discarded Sales Receipts

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-6057`

Discarding a Sales Receipt in POS Pro is now recorded in the action tracking log.
{{% notice info %}}
In CHQ, the action tracking log is available under `settings > server tasks > action tracking`. Discarded Sales Receipts are logged as DocumentDiscarded actions.
{{% /notice %}}
The following information is recorded on discarding a Sales Receipt:

- date
- time
- logged in user
- location
- device ID

Please note that only the Receipts where changes have been made are recorded in the action tracking log. If the user started a new Sales Receipt and then immediately closed the latter, no record is created in the log.

### Sales Receipt: Adding a person from the customer's contacts to the sale

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-4904`

In POS Pro, it's now possible to add a person from the customer's contacts to the sale. 

#### Purpose

The new feature allows users to link a person from the customer's **People** contacts to the Sales Receipt. After finalizing the sale, the linked contact is visible on the receipt in the customer's purchase history.

This may be useful if the customer is buying a gift and wants to be able to review later who it was purchased for.

#### Configuration in CHQ

For the **Select Person** field to be available in POS Pro, make sure that in CHQ under `settings > company settings > v6 App Designer > Point of Sale v6 > iPad > Sales Receipt > Customer Tab`, the **Select Person** label is placed under **layout**.

Also, for the **Select Person** pop-over dialog to automatically display under `Sales Receipt > Customer`, under `chq > settings > sales > sales documents >` the `sales` section, the **prompt for person on add customer** checkbox must be selected.

#### Adding a person to the Sales Receipt

Under `Sales Receipt > Customer`, once a customer record is added to the sale, it becomes possible to link an additional person record.  

To add a person, tap **Select** in the **Select Person** field {{% inum "1" %}}:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_31.png" width="700px"%}}

### Customer: New Customer Profile Link field

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-5442`

We've made available a new **Customer Profile Link** field that appears under `Customer > [selected customer record]` in POS Pro. 

#### Purpose

The **Customer Profile Link** field contains a link to the webpage with additional customer information. 

This may be useful if the retailer uses an external system to store customer information. Now, it is possible to quickly access the web-based customer information from the customer's record in POS Pro.

#### Configuration in CHQ

For the **Customer Profile Link** field to display in POS Pro, it must be configured via v6 App Designer.

In CHQ, make sure that **Customer Profile Link** is placed under **layout** in:

- `settings > company settings > v6 App Designer > Point of Sale v6 > iPad > Customer > Customer Form`, and/or
- `settings > company settings > v6 App Designer > Point of Sale v6 > iPad > Customer > Customer Preview`

#### The Customer Profile Link field in the Customer area

In POS Pro, depending on your custom settings, the **Customer Profile Link** field can appear:

- in the full customer record under `Customer > [selected customer record]`
- in the customer preview under `Customer > See More`

To add a link to the customer's webpage, tap **ADD** in the **Customer Profile Link** field:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_32.png" width="700px"%}}
In the dialog that appears, enter the URL link and then tap **Save**:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_33.png" width="400px"%}}
Once the link is added, it displays in the customer's record:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_34.png" width="700px"%}}
Tapping the link opens the **Link Options** pop-over from which it's possible to:

- open the URL
- edit the link

### Respecting the company location defined for a price level

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-6107`

POS Pro now respects the new **location** setting configured for a price level under `chq > settings > inventory / catalog > price levels > [selected price level]`. The setting allows users to define a company location for which the prices from that price level should be available.

This update helps optimize the time required for POS Pro initialization and synchronization processes. 

Now, if a specific location is defined for a price level, the prices from that price level:

- are not streamed to all the other locations, and
- are not visible in POS Pro for all the other locations

### Respecting the regional price level when calculating item prices

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-6395`

POS Pro now respects the new **regional price level** setting defined in CHQ under `settings > location settings > locations / location settings > [selected location] > details >` the `details` section. 

If the regional price level is defined for a location, POS Pro now uses the latter before the company's base price level for calculation of item prices.

### Support of Banorte

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-3473`

POS Pro now supports credit card payment processing with Banorte. 

#### Configuration in CHQ

In CHQ, the merchant's credentials for Banorte integration can be defined:

- at the company level under `settings > sales > payment processing >` the `Banorte` section
- at the location level under `settings > location settings > locations / location settings > [selected location] > payments >` the `Banorte` section

Also, configuring connection between the POS device and the Banorte terminal is available under `services > device controller > [selected device] > app settings >` the `payment terminal` section.

#### Configuring connection with the Banorte terminal in POS Pro

In POS Pro, to configure connection between your device and the Banorte terminal:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **More** at the bottom-right {{% inum "1" %}}:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_39.png" width="700px"%}}
2. Tap **Settings**.
3. In the left-side panel, tap **Payment Terminals**.
4. Tap **Edit Payment Terminals**.
5. In the **Payment Terminals** dialog, in the **Payment Terminal Type** field, select `Banorte`:
 {{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_40.png" width="400px"%}}
 Then, define the **IP Address** and **Port** to connect with your Banorte terminal.
 {{% notice info %}}
By default, **Port** is set to `1818`.
{{% /notice %}}
6. Tap **Done** in the upper-right corner.

### Configuring tax exemption and tax area for a Sales Receipt

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-5556`

Users can now define the tax exemption status as well as the tax area of a Sales Receipt for accurate tax calculation.  
Configuring the tax exemption status of a Sales Receipt may be necessary when, for example, the customer claims tax exemption on the purchase by providing an appropriate certificate.

#### Configuration in CHQ

To set a tax area for a company location, under `settings > location settings > locations/location settings > [selected location] > details >` the `details` section, define the **tax area** field. The chosen tax area will appear as default on all POS devices initialized at that location but can be changed by users with appropriate security rights.

#### Changing the tax exempt status and tax area 

To change the exemption status and the tax area of a receipt, when in the **Sales Receipt** area:

1. In the right-side panel, tap the value in the **Taxes** field {{% inum "1" %}}:
 {{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_65.png" width="700px"%}}
2. In the **Sale Options** area that opens, to define the entire sale as tax exempt, turn on the **Tax Exempt** switch {{% inum "2" %}}:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_66.png" width="700px"%}}
Please note that to do so, the user must have the **Sales â€“ Sales-Chng. Tax Ex. for sales** security right.  
Additionally, to change the tax area of the receipt, tap the **Tax Area** field {{% inum "3" %}}. To do so, the user must have the **Sales â€“ Chnge Tax Area for sales** security right.
{{% notice note %}}
If the location's default tax area (defined under `chq > settings > location settings > locations/location settings > [selected location] > details`) is VAT type, in POS Pro, the **Tax Area** field is not available for configuration.  
The type of a tax area is defined when the area is created under `chq > settings > company settings > taxes > tax areas`.
{{% /notice %}}
3. Tap **Done** in the upper right corner.

### Standard user interface for integrated payment processors

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-6785`

We're introducing a standardized user interface for interacting with credit card payment processors in POS Pro V6.

#### Purpose

This update allows users to interact with integrated payment processors via a standardized workflow in POS Pro. This eliminates the need for special training when using several integrations in the retailer's environment at the same time. It also may help reduce the possibility of human error.

In particular, the following processes are now similar for all integrated payment processors:

- accepting and processing a payment
- voiding a payment
- voiding/reversing a Sales Receipt
- making a refund to a credit card during a Verified Return
- reviewing completed payments during the End of Day process

#### Configuration in CHQ

For a payment processor to be available in POS Pro, in CHQ, the following is required:

- at the company level, the payment processor must be configured under `settings > sales > payment processing`
- at the location level, the payment processor must be configured under `settings > location settings > locations / location settings > [selected location] > payments`
- a payment method must be set up for the payment processor under `settings > sales > payment methods` and configured for the required location(s) under `settings > sales > payment methods > location settings > [selected location]`
- for payment processors that require a payment terminal, the terminal connection must be configured under `services > device controller > [selected device] > payment terminal` or on the corresponding POS device (see [Configuration in POS](#configuration-in-pos))

#### Configuration in POS
<a name="configuration-in-pos"></a>
If the payment processor requires a connected terminal, in POS Pro, the connection can be configured under `Settings > Payment Terminals > Edit Payment Terminals`:

{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_68.png" width="700px"%}}
{{% notice tip %}}
To define how a payment method is called in POS Pro, in CHQ under `settings > sales > payment methods > [selected payment method]`, define the **code** field.
{{% /notice %}}
5. In the area that opens, set the required payment amount {{% inum "1" %}} and then tap **PROCESS PAYMENT** {{% inum "2" %}}:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_69.png" width="700px"%}}
{{% notice info %}}
The payment amount is automatically suggested if in CHQ under `settings > sales > payment methods > location settings > [selected location]`, the **suggested amt. when positive** checkbox is selected.
{{% /notice %}}
6. When the `Waiting for terminal...` message appears, have the customer swipe, insert, or touch the terminal with their card as required:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_70.png" width="700px"%}}
7. Once the approval is received from the payment processor, the `Approved` icon appears:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_71.png" width="700px"%}}
To return to the **Payment** area, tap **CLOSE** at the bottom. Otherwise, you will be returned automatically in three seconds.

8. Back in the **Payment** area, the taken payment appears on the left:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_72.png" width="700px"%}}
On swiping the payment left, the following options become available:

    - **View**: see payment details
    - **Void**: void the payment (see [Voiding a payment](#voiding-a-payment))

9. Tap **FINALIZE** at the bottom-right.

#### Voiding a payment

#### Reviewing payments during End of Day

Users can review payments associated with a certain payment processor during the End of Day process. 

To do so, under `Drawer Memo > End of Day > PAYMENTS`, in the left-side panel, tap the section with the required payment method:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_76.png" width="700px"%}}
For each payment method, the following tabs are available for reviewing:

### Updated Gift Card functionality: Unified processing and support of GiveX

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-6318`

As of version 6.34 of the software, Teamwork Commerce Pro Suite can support multiple gift card types. This becomes possible via introducing a *unified approach* to gift card processing.

Also, as a part of this update, in addition to existing Teamworkâ€™s native gift card functionality, we have added integration with the GiveX gift card payment processor.

#### Purpose

Teamwork native gift cards can now be used along with GiveX gift cards on the same Sales Receipt.

##### Aligned user interaction

Teamwork and GiveX gift cards will perform with the *same* user interaction at the mobile level. In POS, itâ€™s just required to select what kind of gift card it is on a payment method. The respective gift card type is then passed to CHQ, and CHQ processes that gift card type accordingly.

##### Aligned redemption

Teamwork native as well as GiveX gift cards are redeemed in exactly the same way: 

1. POS requests a charge amount (for example, $50).

2. If the gift card has the amount requested on the card, the transaction is approved.

3. If the gift card has less than the amount requested, the payment is still approved, but only for the balance remaining on the card (**forced redemption**).  
The payment method is then updated to record the reduced amount as the payment. The remaining sum is captured via a different payment method.

4. If the gift card has a zero balance, the payment is rejected.

The update aims at reducing the time required to administer gift card payments.

##### GiveX features

With this update, it is only possible to *redeem* GiveX gift cards.
{{% notice info %}}
Please be advised that the following functionality is currently **NOT** supported for GiveX and will be addressed in future versions:

- selling new
- issuing change back to
- reloading the balance of
- refunding to a gift card
{{% /notice %}}
It is still possible to give change back to, reload the balance of, and sell new Teamwork gift cards.

#### Configuration in CHQ

To be able to make use of the integration with GiveX, the respective payment method as well as payment processing settings must be configured in CHQ. For information on how to do so, see [Configuring integration with Givex](https://twdocs.netlify.app/userdoc/chq/relguides/6.34_chq_relguide/#configuring-integration-with-givex) in CHQ Version 6.34 Release Guide.

#### Taking payments

In Teamwork Commerce POS Pro V6:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **New Sale**.

2. In the **Sales Receipt** area, tap **Payment**.

3. In the **Payment** area, on the right, select the required gift card payment method, for example, `GiveX`.
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_93.png" width="500px"%}}
4. In the area that opens, enter the required amount and then tap **ENTER GIFT CARD** at the bottom.
5. Scan in your customerâ€™s Gift Card or enter the gift cardâ€™s number manually. On scanning/entering a number, POS Pro requests approval of the charge from CHQ.  
If the payment is approved, the following dialog displays:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_94.png" width="250px"%}}
    - **Approved Amount**: the amount of the payment approved, may be less than the requested amount
    - **Authorization Code**: the authorization code that is returned
    - **Card #**: the last four digits of the gift card number (in case of GiveX); for TW native gift cards, masking settings are configured in CHQ
    - **Remaining Balance**: the cardâ€™s balance after the approved charge is removed
    - **Card Expiration**: the expiration date returned with the approval

If POS Pro receives a response that the gift card balance is zero, the `No Funds Available on Card` message displays:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_95.png" width="250px"%}}
If POS Pro receives any error, other than insufficient balance, the `Transaction Not Processed` message displays:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_96.png" width="250px"%}}

#### Issuing change due

Issuing change is allowed for Teamwork native gift cards. For GiveX gift cards, issuing change is currently not supported.

For Teamwork native gift cards, if change is due, the payment amount displays first:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_97.png" width="500px"%}}
Tapping **ENTER GIFT CARD** opens the dialog to scan/enter the gift card number. On scanning/entering a number, POS requests approval from CHQ to load the value to the gift card.   
If the amount is successfully approved and loaded onto the card, the `Approved` dialog displays:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_98.png" width="250px"%}}
If the value cannot be loaded to the card, the `Transaction Not Processed` dialog displays:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_99.png" width="250px"%}}

#### Voiding/Reversing GiveX payments

Gift card payments happen in real-time, when the payment processor is contacted by POS to authorize the payment. 

The user can void the gift card payment only *before* the Sales Receipt is finalized.

Voiding a payment is available via the left-swipe on the **Payment** tab:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_100.png" width="500px"%}}
Also it is possible to tap **Void Payment** at the bottom of the payment details dialog:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_101.png" width="250px"%}}
{{% notice warning %}}
Void/Reverse is unavailable for *finalized* Sales Receipts selling a gift card or containing gift card payments.
{{% /notice %}}
If the void is successful, the respective message displays:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_102.png" width="250px"%}}
In case of an error, the `Void Not Processed` message displays:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_103.png" width="250px"%}}
{{% notice note %}}
If the void cannot be processed and POS does not receive confirmation that the void was approved, the payment is not removed from the Sales Receipt. The user has a few choices in this case:
1. To force close the app and then to restart. In this case, the user is responsible for contacting the processor (Givex or Teamwork CHQ) to have the payment voided manually.
2. Complete the Sales Receipt, then perform a return and refund the customer as per company policy.  
Additionally, if a payment is approved and the application crashes, or the user force closes the application, no detached payment processing/auto-voiding on app restart or during EOD is performed. It is the user's responsibility to recognize this situation and contact the processor to void the payment manually.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Drawer Memo: EOD for GiveX payments

Weâ€™ve added a new **[Givex GC]** tab under the **PAYMENTS** section of **End of Day**:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_104.png" width="500px"%}}
{{% notice info %}}
Please note that the name of the tab is based on the name of the respective payment method. The name of the payment method is defined in CHQ under `settings > sales > payment methods > [selected payment method]` in the **code** field.
{{% /notice %}}
For Givex, there are two tabs available for reviewing:

- **Summary**: displays the number of payments and the total amount
- **Transactions**: displays information on every GiveX transaction taken, including transaction number, date/time, amount, and the last four digits of the gift card number

    - using the **Find Receipt** functionality in the **Sales Receipt** area, or
    - searching under `Sales Receipt > Sales History` or in the **Customer** area (see [V6.33 Mobile Release Guide](https://twdocs.netlify.app/userdoc/pos/relguides/6.33_mobile_rel_guide/) for details on how to start a Verified Return)

### Sales Receipt: Applying Fortress discounts

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-6474`

POS Pro V6 can now retrieve customer records from Fortress and apply Fortress discounts to the sale. 

#### Purpose

Fortress is a payment provider commonly used in the stadium space.

With this update, customers that have Fortress gift cards or tickets can have their Fortress records retrieved in POS Pro. That allows for applying the customer's available discount to the sale.

#### Configuration in CHQ

For Fortress discounts to be available in POS Pro, Fortress integration must be configured:

- at the company level under `settings > sales > payment processing >` the `fortress` section, or
- at the location level under `settings > location settings > locations / location settings > [selected location] > payments >` the `payment processing - fortress` section 

Under the locations described above, make sure that the **enable customer integration** and **enable Fortress discounts** checkboxes are selected.
{{% notice info %}}
Clients upgrading from Version 4 can use the same credentials already set up for Fortress.  
Also, please note that if **URL**, **username**, and **password** are defined at the location level, POS Pro uses the location-level settings over the company-level settings.  
{{% /notice %}}

#### Applying a Fortress discount to the sale

To apply a Fortress discount, in POS Pro:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **New Sale**. 

2. Add items to the sale. Note that Fortress discounts can be applied before or after adding sale items.

3. Tap the **Customer** tab at the top. On the **Customer** tab, the following sections are available:
    - **Teamwork** for searching customers in Teamwork, and 
    - **Fortress** for searching Fortress customers
{{% notice tip %}}
The name of the **Fortress** section can be changed in CHQ under `settings > sales > payment processing > fortress` by defining the **search label** field. If the field is blank, `Fortress` displays in POS Pro by default.
{{% /notice %}}
4. In the **Fortress** section, search for the required customer by:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_89.png" width="700px"%}}
    - tapping **Scan with Camera** {{% inum "1" %}} and scanning the customer's card/ticket with the camera, or
    - manually entering or scanning the number of the card/ticket into the **Search Fortress** field {{% inum "2" %}}

Once the customer is found, the following information will be available under **FORTRESS CUSTOMER**:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_90.png" width="700px"%}}
- the customer's name
- the discount percentage that will be applied to the receipt
- the customer's balance in Fortress available for spending 

Additionally, the user has the following options:
- **Remove Discount**: remove the discount from the sale, for example, if the customer wants to apply a different Fortress card/ticket
- **Remove from Sale**: remove the customer record from the sale

Also, in the right-side panel showing totals, the **Customer Discount** field will appear showing the total Fortress discount:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_91.png" width="700px"%}}

5. Tap **PAYMENT** at the bottom-right.
6. Choose the required payment method and accept the payment.
7. Tap **FINALIZE**.

### Synchronizing POS Pro after initialization

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-4861`

We've updated the synchronization process between POS Pro and CHQ. In particular:

- synchronization now begins automatically after every initialization or re-initialization, and
- synchronization includes sending the latest security related information (for example, users' login credentials) to POS

#### Purpose

This update is helpful in a scenario where POS Pro is deleted from the device shortly after a user's password was changed.
Synchronizing after the initialization allows for sending the updated login credentials to POS. That will allow the user to log in with the new password.

#### Updated synchronization

In POS Pro, initialization is performed:

- automatically after the POS Pro app is installed
- when triggered manually under `Settings > Administration`

Now, after initialization or re-initialization is complete and the user taps **Done**, synchronization begins in the **Synchronize** dialog:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_92.png" width="400px"%}}
If the user taps **Cancel** during synchronization, the **Cancel Synchronize** dialog appears with the following message: `Cancelling this process may result in out-of-date login credentials. Are you sure?`

Tapping **Yes** cancels synchronization and opens the user login dialog. 

### RFID reader: Ignoring RFID tags that do not start with configured EPC prefixes

`Build 6.34.234: PRO-7395`

POS Pro now respects the **RFID allowed prefixes** setting configured in CHQ under`settings > sales > POS settings >` the `general` section.

When working in conjunction with an RFID reader, POS Pro now ignores RFID item tags with Electronic Product Codes (EPCs) that do not start with the prefixes defined in the **RFID allowed prefixes** setting. Please note that if no prefixes are defined, *all* EPCs are read by POS Pro.

This feature may be useful if the company uses RFID tags that don't belong to the product catalog (for example, security tags) and shouldn't appear in POS Pro.

### Updated force redemption method for GiveX

`Build 6.34.248: PRO-7559`

Weâ€™ve updated the force redemption method used for GiveX to allow for redeeming if a gift card balance is lower than the payment due.

### Updated logic for Fortress integration

`Build 6.34.248: PRO-7578`

As of version 6.34.248, the call to Fortress to check the gift card balance is made after transaction completion.

## Issue Resolutions

### The "No take in reasons" message appears when trying to create a Take Out

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2177`

**Issue**

When trying to create a Take Out record under `Drawer Memo > Take Out/In`, the `No take IN reasons defined on CHQ` error message could appear even if there were Take Out reasons defined.

**Resolution** 

Now, as expected, when trying to create a Take Out:

- if there are Take Out reasons defined in CHQ, a new Take Out record is created
- if there are no Take Out reasons defined in CHQ, the `No take OUT reasons defined on CHQ` error message appears

### Sales Receipt: The Check payment method doesn't support decimal numbers

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2206`

We've fixed the issue where, when using the Check payment method under `Sales Receipt > Payment`, the payment due amount would display incorrectly if the sale total was a decimal number. 

### RFID Tag Status: Tag information periodically disappears from the screen

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2161`

Prior to version 6.34.78, when viewing the status of an RFID item tag under `Home Screen > RFID Tag Status`, the tag information would periodically disappear and then appear on the screen again. 

The issue has been fixed. Now, as expected, the tag information is visible on the screen until the tag is removed from the RFID reader. 

### Sales Receipt: The font size for the email address increased

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2288`

Under `Sales Receipt > Payment`, we've increased the font size for the customer's email address to match the standard font size of similar fields.

### The Open Return tag incorrectly applied to Verified Return items

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2222`

Prior to version 6.34, when the user viewed a finalized Verified Return under `Sales Receipts > Sales History`, the **Open Return** tag could be incorrectly applied to the return items.

The issue has been fixed. Now, the items are correctly tagged as **Verified Return**. 

### Tax amount from Verified Returns not sent to CHQ

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2324`

We've fixed the issue where the tax amount from a finalized Verified Return sometimes wasn't passed to CHQ. That happened when the Verified Return was performed on the same device where the original sale was finalized. 

### Sales Receipt: Return reason not saved after finalization

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2310`

We've fixed the issue where the **Return Reason** applied to a return item sometimes wasn't saved in the finalized Sales Receipt. Instead, under `Sales Receipt > Cart > [item name] - edit dialog > Return`, `Select` would display in the **Return Reason** field.

### Creating a new customer record with invalid Primary Email

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2350`

**Issue**

Under `Sales Receipt > Customer > New Customer`, it was possible to create a new customer record with an invalid **Primary Email**. In the created record, the **Primary Email** field would be empty. 

**Resolution**

Now, if the user enters an invalid email address, the **Add** button is disabled as expected. 

### Sales Receipt: Search for store pickup locations is case-sensitive

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2351`

Prior to version 6.34, under `Sales Receipt > Cart > [item name] - edit > Ship`, search for store pickup locations was case-sensitive. 

The issue has been fixed. Now, the search is case-insensitive. 

### Saved customer record doesn't appear in the finalized Sales Receipt

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2180`

**Issue**

When the user opened a finalized Sales Receipt under `Sales Receipts > Sales History`, the **Customer** tab was sometimes empty even if a customer record was saved on the receipt at the time of the sale. 

**Resolution**

The issue has been fixed. Now, if a customer record was saved on the receipt at the time of the sale, that record appears in the finalized Sales Receipt as expected. 

### Unable to cancel Sales Receipt printing

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2242`

We've fixed the issue where, under `Sales Receipt > Sales History > [selected Sales Receipt]`, when the user tapped **Print** and then **Cancel**, the receipt would be printed anyway.

### Sales History: The Customer and Payment columns are empty for some Sales Receipts

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2348`

We've fixed the issue where, under `Sales Receipts > Sales History`, the **Customer** and **Payment** columns would be empty for some Sales Receipts created at a different company location.

### Performing returns of shipped items

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2376`

Prior to version 6.34.234, under `Sales Receipts > Sales History > [selected Sales Receipt]`, it was possible to make a Verified Return of an item that was shipped to the customer's address.

Now, returning shipped items is no longer possible. When the user taps **Return Item(s)** with a ship item selected, the **Return Unavailable** error message appears.

### Cash drawer is not opening

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2388`

We've fixed the issue where, after the user quickly tapped **Open Cash Drawer** twice in the **Drawer Memo** area, the cash drawer would fail to open from the following areas:

- `Drawer Memo > Start of Day`
- `Home Screen > More > Settings > Printers`

### Verified Return: Incorrect application of the Non-Returnable tag

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2358`

Prior to version 6.34, when the user scanned a printed Sales Receipt in the **Find Receipt** area, in the **RETURN** area that opened, all items were incorrectly tagged as **Non-Returnable**:
{{% gimg src="V6.34 Mob Release Guide/6.34_posrelguide_106.png" width="700px"%}}
The issue has been fixed. Now, the **Non-Returnable** tag is only applied to items that cannot be returned. 

### Applied global discounts display twice in finalized Sales Receipts

`Build 6.34.234: DS-2343`

**Issue**

Under `Sales Receipts > Sales History > [selected finalized SR] > Sale Options`, applied global discounts would incorrectly display twice under the following conditions:

- more than one global discount was applied, and
- the discount percent was edited on adding

**Resolution**

The issue has been fixed. Now, in the finalized Sales Receipt, global discounts display without duplicates as expected.

### Drawer Memo: Incorrect value color for SOD Over/Short discrepancies

`Build 6.34.248: DS-2467`

Weâ€™ve fixed the issue where the value in the **SOD Over/Short** field in the right-hand section of Drawer Memo would display in black instead of red in case of discrepancy.

### Drawer Memo: Currency symbol incorrectly displayed in Prev Count

`Build 6.34.248: DS-2469`

Prior to version 6.34.248, on the **Opening Count** tab of the Drawer Memoâ€™s **Start of Day**, the currency symbol in the Prev Count column would incorrectly display.

The issue has been fixed. In the **Prev Count** column, the values now display without any currency symbol as expected.

### Different line order of Items in Sales and Return Receipts

`Build 6.34.248: DS-2474`

Weâ€™ve fixed the issue where the line order of items in a Verified Return Receipt differed from the original Sales Receipt.

### The Prev Count column is not populated in Drawer Memoâ€™s SOD

`Build 6.34.255: DS-2468`

Prior to version 6.34.248, the **Prev Count** column under `Drawer Memo > Start of Day > Opening Count` would not be populated with values from the previous Drawer Memo.

The issue has been fixed. Now, the **Prev Count** column is populated with the respective values as expected.

### Verified Returns: Receipts not synchronized

`Build 6.33.255: DS-2470`

Weâ€™ve fixed the issue where finalized Verified Return receipts would fail to synchronize if prior to finalizing those had been placed "on hold".

### Verified Returns: Failure to refund from POS

`Build 6.34.255: DS-2494`

Weâ€™ve fixed the issue where refunds to the original card initiated in POS for web orders could occasionally fail with the `Payment Not Processed. Refund failed. An error occurred during CHQ refund procedure` error message.

### Drawer Memo: Incorrect calculation of Counted Amount and Over/Short in the Closing Count of SAFE CASH

`Build 6.34.263: DS-2491`

Weâ€™ve fixed the issue where in Drawer Memo during the End of Day calculations the **Counted Amount** and **Over/Short** values under `SAFE CASH > Closing Count` would incorrectly be increased by the **Pending Move to Safe** value. That would happen each time the user manually switched from **Finalize** to `SAFE CASH > Closing Count`.

### Fortress Gift Cards: Failure to perform a Verified Return in several transactions

`Build 6.34.263: DS-2535`

Weâ€™ve fixed the issue where if a Verified Return was split into two transactions, the second transaction would not return to a Fortress Gift Card.

### Double refunds to credit cards

`Build 6.34.270: DS-2590`

Weâ€™ve fixed the issue where refunds to the credit card could be granted twice for the same order.
