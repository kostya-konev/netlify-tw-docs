## Feature Descriptions

### Automatic logging out on completion of the End of Day process

`Build 6.31.45: PRO-3488`

After completing the End of Day process in POS Pro under `Drawer Memo > End of Day`, the user is now automatically returned to the **Home Screen** and logged out.

This feature prevents situations where the store associate may fail to log out of POS Pro at the end of the day, so that on the next day, another employee may accidentally continue working under another person’s account.

### Drawer Memo: Restricting access to safe related values and actions

`Build 6.31.45: PRO-3536`

The POS Pro app now respects the following new security rights:

- **Drawer Memo – Access/edit safe values**
- **Drawer Memo – Print drawer memo/deposit slip**

{{% notice info %}}
In CHQ, a user’s security rights can be configured under `settings > security > users > [selected user] > rights`.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Purpose

If the user doesn’t have the security rights described above, certain safe related values and actions are not available in the **Drawer Memo** area of POS Pro.

This feature may be used to prevent store associates with insufficient permissions from seeing what amount of money is stored in the store’s safe.

#### Restriction of safe related values and actions

If the user doesn’t have the **Drawer Memo – Access/edit safe values** and/or **Drawer Memo – Print drawer memo/deposit slip** security rights, changes take place in the following POS Pro areas:

- `Drawer Memo`
- `Drawer Memo > Start of Day`
- `Drawer Memo > End of Day`

#### Restrictions in the Drawer Memo area

In both active and finalized Drawer Memos, if the user doesn’t have the **Drawer Memo – Access/edit safe values** right, all the fields under the **SAFE** section display the `N/A` value (see the screenshot below):

{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_1.png" title="Drawer Memo: N/A safe values" width="700px"%}}

Also, if the user doesn’t have the **Drawer Memo – Print drawer memo/deposit slip** security right, on tapping **Print** in the upper right corner (**A** in the screenshot below), the **Insufficient Rights** message displays.

{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_2.png" title="Drawer Memo: The Print button" width="700px"%}}

#### Restrictions in the Start of Day area

Under `Drawer Memo > Start of Day`, if the user doesn’t have the **Drawer Memo – Access/edit safe values** right, the following changes take place:

- The **SAFE CASH** section is hidden.
{{% notice warning %}}
If the **SAFE CASH** section is hidden, the user won’t be able to enter the **Opening Amount** value under **SAFE CASH – Opening Count**. This may lead to a discrepancy between the **Opening Amount** and the **Left in Safe (Previous Drawer Memo)** amount.

Additionally, if the **require notes start and end of day with over/short/discrepancy** checkbox is enabled in CHQ (`settings > drawer management > drawer memo settings`), on completing the Start of Day process, the user is notified that notes are required to account for the discrepancy.

In this case, it is advised that the user cancel the process by tapping **Cancel** in the upper left corner and have a user with the appropriate security rights enter the **Opening Amount** for the **SAFE CASH**.
{{% /notice %}}

- Under **COMPLETE – Summary**, in the **SAFE CASH** section, the `N/A` value is shown in the **Opening Amount** field:
{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_3.png" title="Complete - Summary: N/A safe values" width="700px"%}}
Also, in the **Opening Difference** field, `No` or `Yes` displays depending on whether there is a discrepancy between the **Opening Amount** and the **Left in Safe (Previous Drawer Memo)** amount.  
Additionally, under `Start of Day > COMPLETE – Summary`, if the user doesn’t have the **Drawer Memo – Print drawer memo/deposit slip** security right and tries to enable the **Print Start of Day** switch (**A** in the screenshot below), the **Insufficient Rights** message displays.
{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_4.png" title="Complete - Summary: The Print Start of Day switch" width="700px"%}}

### UI updates to accommodate translations of payment methods

`Build 6.31.45: PRO-3620`

In POS Pro version 6, it is possible to see translations of certain UI labels by changing the language of the app’s interface under `Setting > Administration`.  

To accommodate translations of payment methods that require longer text strings, we’ve increased the height of all payment method labels located under `Sales Receipt > Payment`.

Now, longer translations can be split into two lines if required.

### RFID Tag Status: Availability from the Home Screen

`Build 6.31.45: PRO-3665`

Opening the **RFID Tag Status** area of POS Pro where it’s possible to check and manually change the status of an RFID item tag is now possible from POS **Home Screen**.

#### Purpose

The capability to check if an item’s tag is on or off is important for knowing if that tag will trigger the store’s EAS theft prevention system.
{{% notice info %}}  
The **electronic article surveillance (EAS)** system is designed to prevent shoplifting from stores. Typically, the EAS detection system at the store exit sounds an alarm when it senses an active tag on the merchandise. 
Therefore, deactivating RFID tags during the checkout process is necessary to allow sold merchandise through the EAS system.
{{% /notice %}}
Also, manually changing the tag status may be required if the tag couldn’t be automatically turned on or off during tag reprogramming after the sale.

#### Configuration in CHQ

For the **RFID Tag Status** button to be available on POS **Home Screen**, it needs to be configured in **v6 App Designer**.

Under `chq > settings > company settings > v6 App Designer > Point of Sale v6 > iPad > Home`, place the **RFID Tag Status** label in the **layout** area.

If the **RFID Tag Status** label is among the first five labels under layout, on POS **Home Screen**, it displays in the navigation panel at the bottom (**A** in the screenshot below):

{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_5.png" title="The RFID Tag Status button on Home Screen" width="700px"%}}

Alternatively, if the **RFID Tag Status** label is in the sixth position or lower, on POS **Home Screen**, it displays in the flyout menu that opens on tapping **More** (**B** in the screenshot below):

{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_6.png" title="The More menu" width="700px"%}}

{{% notice info %}}
For details on configuring the **RFID Tag Status** label in v6 App Designer, see [V6.31 CHQ Release Guide](https://teamworkclients.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TD/pages/1353285735/Version+6+Series+CHQ+Release+Guides) in Teamwork Confluence. 
{{% /notice %}}

#### Changing the status of an RFID item tag

To manually change the status of an RFID tag, in POS Pro:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **RFID Tag Status**. Depending on your custom settings, the **RFID Tag Status** can display either in the navigation panel at the bottom or in the **More** menu.
2. In the **RFID Tag Status** area, place the item tag on or near the connected RFID reader.
   {{% notice note %}}
   Only one tag at a time can be placed on the RFID reader to correctly check its status.
   {{% /notice %}}
   Once the item is scanned, information about the item displays in the area:
   {{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_7.png" title="Item info in the RFID Tag Status area" width="700px"%}}
3. Tap the value in the **Change RFID Tag Status** field (`Turn OFF` or `Turn ON` depending on the current status):
   {{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_8.png" title="The Change RFID Tag Status value" width="700px"%}}
   {{% notice note %}}
   To be able to turn off an RFID tag, the user must be granted the **Sales Receipts – Manually deactivate RFID tags** security right. 
   {{% /notice %}}
4. If the user doesn’t have appropriate security rights and manager credentials are required, in the **RFID Tag Status Change** dialog, tap **Manager Override**:
   {{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_9.png" title="The RFID Tag Status Change dialog" width="300px"%}}
5. In the log in dialog, have the user with the appropriate security rights enter their credentials and then tap **Log In**.

After the manager override is complete, the status of the RFID tag will be changed and displayed in the **RFID Tag Status** area.

### Drawer Memo: End of Day starts on the Drawer Cash – Closing Count tab

`Build 6.31.45: PRO-3787`

Previously, when going through the End of Day process under `Drawer Memo > End of Day`, the user needed to go through all available tabs from **Payments** to **Finalize**.

Now, the End of Day area automatically opens on the **Drawer Cash – Closing Count** tab (see the screenshot below) skipping all the **Payments** tabs located above.
{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_10.png" title="DM: Drawer Cash - Closing Count" width="700px"%}}
This update allows users to avoid mistakes where they accidentally skip other tabs in the area when quickly going through the **Payments** section by tapping **Next**.

The user can still return to the **Payments** section at any moment by tapping the required tab.

### Multi-language item attributes

`Build 6.31.45: PRO-3056`

We’ve added the capability to set up multiple translations for item attribute labels (such as `Size` or `Color`) that display in the following areas of POS Pro:

- Catalog
- Sales Receipt
- Purchase History
- Ship Memo
- Count Memo
- Adjustment
{{% notice note %}}
 Please be advised that an attribute translation must first be set up in CHQ by clicking the **globe** icon under `settings > inventory / catalog > attributes > [selected attribute] > the attribute tab`.  Once a translation is defined in CHQ, in POS Pro, it’s required to change the user interface language under `Settings > Administration` for the translation to be visible.

### Sales Receipt: Updated layout of the Payment area

`Build 6.31.70: PRO-3328`

We’ve updated the layout of the **Payment** area of POS Pro V6 located under `Sales Receipt > Payment`.

The following changes were made:

- The **PRINT/EMAIL** section where it’s possible to define if the Sales Receipt should be printed and/or emailed is now located at the bottom-left:
{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_12.png" title="The PRINT/EMAIL section: New location" width="700px"%}}
- The **Print Options** button that opens the dialog with default printing configurations is now located next to the **PRINT/EMAIL** section:
{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_13.png" title="The Print Options button: New location" width="700px"%}}
- The **Payment Due/Change Due** section showing the total payment or change amount was moved to the bottom-right:
{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_14.png" title="The Payment Due/Change Due section: New location" width="700px"%}}
- The **Discard** button was renamed to **Discard Sale** and moved to the top-right:
{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_15.png" title="The Discard Sale button: New location" width="700px"%}}

### Issuing invoices in POS Pro V6

`Build 6.31.70: PRO-3328, PRO-3748`

POS Pro V6 now provides the capability to issue invoices for both sales and return transactions.
{{% notice note %}}
The invoice functionality is not available for countries that were not registered as fiscal in Teamwork. This update addresses invoice related fiscal requirements that are specific to Spain as well as adds basic invoice functionality to the POS Pro app.
{{% /notice %}}
{{% notice info %}}
Please note that, to register a country as fiscal as well as meet specific fiscalization requirements, a request has to be submitted to Teamwork to plan such adjustments at the backend.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Purpose

This feature may be helpful if the retailer is required to issue an invoice in case of a large purchase or a business-to-business sale. An invoice will contain additional information compared to Teamwork’s regular Sales Receipt, such as customer information. 

The customer information can be edited or populated from scratch when generating the invoice. This may be helpful if, for example, an employee is buying goods for their company. In that case, the company’s information must be printed on the invoice and not the customer’s personal information.

#### Configuration in CHQ

In CHQ, fiscalization related settings are now configured at the level of the country. This allows for applying these settings to all locations of the company in that country.

If a country is registered as fiscal in Teamwork, under `settings > company settings > countries/regions > [selected country]`, the `fiscal` and `invoice customer` tabs become visible where it’s possible to configure fiscalization related settings.
{{% notice info %}}
For more information on configuring the settings mentioned above, see [V6.31 CHQ Release Guide](https://teamworkclients.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TD/pages/1353285735/Version+6+Series+CHQ+Release+Guides) in Teamwork Confluence. 
{{% /notice %}}

#### Issuing an invoice in POS Pro

To issue an invoice, in POS Pro:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **New Sale**.
2. In the **Sales Receipt** area, add a customer and sale items. Alternatively, if the invoice is to be issued for a return, add a customer and return items.
   {{% notice info %}}
   For information on how to add a customer and items to the sale, see the **Sales Receipt: Adding a customer and items to the sale** guide in [Mobile Quick Reference Guides](https://teamworkclients.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TD/pages/1515062233/iPad+POS+Quick+Reference+Guides).  To learn how to make an Open Return, see the **Making an Open Return** guide in [Mobile Quick Reference Guides](https://teamworkclients.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TD/pages/1515062233/iPad+POS+Quick+Reference+Guides).
   {{% /notice %}}
3. Tap **Payment** at the bottom-right.
4. In the **Payment** area, turn on the **Issue Invoice** switch:
   {{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_16.png" title="SR: The Issue Invoice switch" width="700px"%}}
   {{% notice note %}}
   If the transaction total meets the **auto issue invoices when total reaches** threshold set in CHQ under `settings > company settings > countries/regions > [selected country] > fiscal`, in POS Pro, the **Issue Invoice** switch is turned on automatically and cannot be disabled.

   The **auto issue invoices when total reaches** threshold is applicable to both positive (sales) and negative amounts (Open Returns).
   Setting a threshold may be useful if the retailer is required to issue an invoice for purchases larger than a certain amount.
   {{% /notice %}}
5. In the **Invoice Information** dialog that opens, enter the customer information and then tap **Done** in the upper right corner:
   {{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_17.png" title="SR: The Invoice Information dialog" width="500px"%}}
   {{% notice info %}}
   If a customer was assigned to the sale in the **Sales Receipt** area, available information from the customer’s record automatically displays in the **Invoice Information** dialog.  However, it’s possible to edit the fields if a company’s information must be saved on the invoice instead of the customer’s personal data. The customer’s record will NOT be updated with this information. 
   {{% /notice %}}
   Tapping **Done** returns you to the **Payment** area. In the **Payment** area, the customer information on the invoice can be edited again by tapping **Edit** next to the **Issue Invoice** switch.
6. In the **Payment** area, to define if the invoice should be printed or emailed to the customer, under **PRINT/EMAIL**, select **Invoice** (**A** in the screenshot below) or the email address (**B** in the screenshot) respectively:
   {{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_18.png" title="Printing or emailing the invoice" width="700px"%}}
   {{% notice note %}}
   For Spain, printing and emailing an invoice at the same time is not available.
   {{% /notice %}}
   {{% notice info %}}
   To configure the printing/emailing options for the invoice, tap **Print Options** next to the **PRINT/EMAIL** section. Tapping **Print Options** opens the **Invoice** dialog.  
   In the **Invoice** dialog, once finished configuring the settings, tap **Print** in the upper right corner.
   {{% /notice %}}
7. Select a payment method and accept the required amount.
8. In the **Payment** area, tap **Finalize**.

After finalizing, the invoice will be printed out or emailed to the customer depending on the user’s configuration.

### F-NEDAP RFID reader: New Connection Type setting

`Build 6.31.70: PRO-3989`

For the F-NEDAP RFID reader, we’ve added a new **Connection Type** setting that can be configured under `Setting > RFID Reader`:
{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_20.png" title="Settings: Connection Type" width="700px"%}}
The new setting allows the user to define whether the F-NEDAP reader should use Wi-Fi or Ethernet to communicate with the iPad. 

On a new installation, “Ethernet” is set by default.

### Customer: Membership expiration date is no longer a required field

`Build 6.31.70: PRO-3992`

In customer records, the **Membership Expires** field that indicates the date of the customer’s membership expiration is no longer required.

By default, the **Membership Expires** field is empty.
{{% notice info %}}
To open a specific customer record in POS Pro, do the following:

1. On the **Home Screen**, tap **Customer**. Depending on your custom settings, the **Customer** button can be located in the navigation panel at the bottom or in the **More** menu. 
2. In the **Customer** area, use the **Customer Search** field at the top to find the required customer. Alternatively, tap **Scan with Camera** to scan the customer’s membership code. If multiple results are found:
    - to open the full customer profile, tap the row with the required customer. Once opened, the full profile can be edited
    - to see basic read-only customer information, tap **See More** in the required row

## Issue Resolutions

### Sales Receipt: Promotions aren’t applied to eligible items

`Build 6.31.45: DS-1846`

We’ve fixed the issue where promotions that were restricted to a certain membership level didn’t apply to sale items automatically even if all promotion requirements were met.

### Missing translation for the “This Location” value

`Build 6.31.45: DS-1856`

Prior to version 6.31.45, under `Sales Receipt > Select Associate`, the `This Location` value in the **Showing associates for** filter wasn’t translated properly when changing the app’s interface language to any other than English.

Now, the value is correctly translated to all available app interface languages.
{{% gimg src="631_posrelguide_21.png" title="This Location value" width="700px"%}}

### Drawer Memo: The Notes field is misaligned

`Build 6.31.45: DS-1854`

We’ve fixed the issue where the **Notes** field under `Drawer Memo > Start of Day > Complete – Summary > Add Notes` and `Drawer Memo > End of Day > Finalize – Finalize > Add Notes` was not properly aligned with the **Pre-Set Notes** button above.

### Settings: Part of the Edit RFID Reader label isn’t properly translated

`Build 6.31.45: DS-1860`

Prior to version 6.31.45, the word `Edit` in the **Edit RFID Reader** button located under `Settings > RFID Reader` wasn’t properly translated to other languages.

We’ve fixed the issue and now the whole **Edit RFID Reader** label is properly translated as expected.

### Sales Receipt: The Credit Card payment amount is incorrectly incremented

`Build 6.31.45: DS-1867`

**Issue**

Under `Sales Receipt > Payment >` the **Credit Card** payment method, when the user entered a payment amount, it would be automatically replaced with an incorrect incremented amount. 

That happened when all of the following conditions were observed:

- in POS Settings, the **Region** was set to `Switzerland`
- in POS Settings, the **Language** was set to `French`
- in CHQ, the **allow for positive amount** checkbox was cleared under `settings > sales > payment methods > [selected Credit Card payment method]`
- in CHQ, the **disable integrated processing** checkbox was selected under `settings > sales > payment methods > location settings > [selected location]`

**Resolution**

The issue has been fixed. Now, under the conditions described above, the user can enter the required payment amount as expected.

### The MembershipCode column is incorrectly populated with “NULL”

`Build 6.31.45: DS-1869`

**Issue**

At the database level, the MembershipCode column of the Sales.Receipt table was incorrectly populated with `NULL` even if the respective Sales Receipt finalized in POS Pro had a customer with the MembershipCode populated. 

**Resolution**

Now, if on the Sales Receipt there was a customer with the MembershipCode populated, the MembershipCode column of the Sales.Receipt table is populated with the respective value.

### Customer: The Type field incorrectly displays as required

`Build 6.31.70: DS-1858`

**Issue**

When a new customer record was created in POS Pro, under the **Attributes** section, the non-editable **Type** field would display as a required field.

**Resolution**

The issue has been fixed. Now, the **Type** field is not required for creating a customer record.

### Sales Receipt: Incorrect application of the “Ship” label

`Build 6.31.70: DS-1871`

**Issue**

Sometimes, when a discount was added to a sale item under `Sales Receipt > Cart`, the `Ship` label would be incorrectly applied to that item along with the `Discount` label.

**Resolution**

Now, the `Ship` label is not applied when a discount is added to the item.

### Customer information is not printed on the Sales Receipt

`Build 6.31.70: DS-1859`

Prior to version 6.31.45, customer information would sometimes fail to appear on the printed Sales Receipt.

That happened when the customer record was created at the time of sale by tapping **New Customer** under `Sales Receipt > Customer`.

The issue has been fixed. Now, customer information is printed on the Sales Receipt as expected.

### Customer: Non-editable fields are not greyed out

`Build 6.31.70: DS-1859`

We’ve fixed the issue where, in a customer record, field names and values in the **Attributes** section weren’t greyed out if the user didn’t have the appropriate security right to edit them.

Now, non-editable field names and values are greyed out as expected.

### Purchasing a Gift Card doesn’t change the Sales Receipt total

`Build 6.31.74: DS-1881`

We’ve fixed the issue where adding a Gift Card to the customer’s purchase under `Sales Receipt > Cart` sometimes didn’t change the total payment amount.

### The “Invalid Currency” error when processing Adyen Credit Card payments in Swiss Francs

`Build 6.31.78: DS-1904`

Prior to version 6.31.78, for store locations where the Swiss Franc (CHF) is selected as the base currency, trying to process a Credit Card payment with Adyen would lead to the **Invalid Currency** error.

The issue has been fixed. Now, for such locations, Adyen Credit Card payments are processed as expected.

### Synchronization failed after trying to reprint a Sales Receipt

`Build 6.31.81: DS-1930`

We’ve fixed the issue where manual synchronization of the POS Pro app can’t complete due to the **PRINT_NUMBER_ALREADY_EXISTS** error if the following is done prior to it:

1. The user tries to reprint a Sales Receipt, and Internet connection is lost before the user taps **Print** in the **Print Options** dialog
2. Then, synchronization is started, and Internet connection is lost during the **Upload Fiscal Receipt Reprint History** step

### Synchronization failed with the “Internal server error”

`Build 6.31.81: PRO-4553`

Prior to version 6.31.81, manual synchronization of the POS Pro app could fail with the **Internal server error** if the following occurred prior to it:

1. For a location with **country** = `Italy`, the correct fiscal printer was set up, and the active Drawer Memo finalized
2. Then, under `Settings > Fiscal Device > Edit Fiscal Device`, the fiscal device was incorrectly changed to a TSE device
3. A new Drawer Memo was created and then finalized
Now, under the conditions described above, synchronization completes as expected.

### Synchronization failed due to Transfer Memo status discrepancy

`Build 6.31.81: DS-1937`

We’ve fixed the issue where manual synchronization of the POS Pro app can’t complete due to the **TRANSFER_MEMO_WRONG_STATUS** error if the following occurs prior to it:

1. A Transfer Out is finalized at the source location with the configured 10-second posting delay. During the delay, the Internet connection is lost, and the Transfer Out is saved to POS local database
2. At the target location, the associated Transfer In is finalized
