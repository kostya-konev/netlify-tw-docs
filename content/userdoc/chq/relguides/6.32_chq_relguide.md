## Services

### Added support of a new printer model – IP AirPrint

`Build 6.32.49.0: PRO-4787`

In CHQ, we added the capability to configure connection to AirPrint printers using the IP address. Once configured in CHQ, the respective printer becomes available in POS.

{{% notice note %}}
Please be advised that it is also possible to configure connection with the IP AirPrint printer in POS. For further information, see [V6.32 Mobile Release Guide](https://teamworkclients.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TD/pages/1381565273/Version+6+Mobile+Release+Guides "Version 6 – Mobile Release Guides in Teamwork Confluence").

#### Purpose

AirPrint is a technology that allows an Apple device and a printer to communicate via a wireless network. With AirPrint, a POS device can quickly connect to the required printer without any cables or printer-specific drivers.

However, the AirPrint technology doesn’t work across multiple subnetworks if the retailer employs network segmentation in their environment.

{{% notice info %}}
**Network segmentation** is the process of sectioning off one network into smaller segments, or “subnetworks”, in such a way that limits or prevents communication between them. It is a security practice employed in retail environments for protection of cardholders’ data as well as for ensuring PCI compliance.
{{% /notice %}}

To communicate with a POS device in such an environment, AirPrint printers must be:

* set up within the same subnetwork as the device sending out the printing data, and
* connected to that device using the IP address

Thus, to allow mobile devices to communicate with AirPrint printers in conditions described above, we’ve made available the IP-based connection.

#### How to add the IP AirPrint printer

To make the IP AirPrint printer available for your POS device, in CHQ:

1. Go to `services > device controller`.
2. Find your device and click it.
3. In the **edit device** dialog that opens, go to the **direct printers** tab.
4. Click **new** to open the **printer** dialog:
{{% gimg src="632_chq_airprint1.jpg" width="400px"%}}

5. In the dialog, populate the following fields:

    * **printer**: indicate your printer number
    * **name**: specify your printer name
    * **type**: make sure that `network/IP` is selected (set by default)
    * **model**: select `IP AirPrint`
    * **IP/MAC address**: specify your printer IP or MAC address

6. Click **save** twice.  
On clicking **save**, all the updates made in the **direct printers** tab are streamed to the respective POS device.

We’ve introduced the capability to view the full Gift Card number in the following areas of CHQ:

* `sales > customer > sales`
* `sales > sales receipts > items`

#### Purpose

Checking the full Gift Card number may be useful, for example, when the customer loses the Gift Card and comes into a store for help. In that case, the store associate can sell a new Gift Card for the balance remaining and use the lost Gift Card number (retrieved from CHQ) to pay for the transaction.

#### New Security right

We’ve added a new security right that allows the user to view the full Gift Card number in the respective areas of CHQ:

Area        | Right | Description |

### European fiscal compliance – Germany

`Build 6.32.35.0: PRO-3623, PRO-3727`

In CHQ, we’ve added the capabilities to:

* configure connection with a certified fiscal device
* define a custom fiscal name for a payment method
* define a fiscal code for a tax category
* configure Germany specific fiscal settings

#### Purpose

The updates ensure Teamwork Commerce Pro Suite is compliant with the following fiscal requirements of German authorities:

1. The POS Pro app must be connected with a certified TSE device (German: **T**echnische **S**icherheits**e**inheit, or “technical safety device”) at all times. This device receives all fiscal data during POS day-to-day operations and provides for the data’s security and inalterability. TSE also provides storage for fiscal-related data. Through POS Pro, this storage can be accessed to provide a fiscal report for tax auditing purposes.
2. The payment method used during the sale must be recorded on the fiscal device with a standard name. The same name is then used to refer to the respective payment method in a fiscal report generated in POS Pro V6.
3. In fiscal reports and on Sales Receipts, tax rates collected during the sale must be represented by fiscal codes. Additionally, the TSE device requires the fiscal code to be present on the issued Sales Receipt.

#### Configuring the connection to the TSE device

To configure the connection between the TSE device and the POS Pro app on an individual device, in CHQ:

1. Go to `services > device controller`.
2. Find your device and click it.

## Other Enhancements

### JSON-based Secure Customers Import API: the KeyField setting supports "Email"

`Build 6.32.35.0: PRO-4218`

The *KeyField* setting of the JSON-based Secure Customers Import API now supports the `Email` value in addition to `EID`, `MembershipCode` and `No`. This enhancement allows for updating light customer records by the email address.

### JSON-based Customer Export API: the “Search” operator added to filters

`Build 6.32.39.0: DS-1635`

As of version 6.32.39.0, the filtering functionality of the JSON-based Customer Export API has been extended with the *Search* operator.

The *Search* operator is available for the following fields:

* CustomerFirstName
* CustomerLastName
* CustomerMiddleName
* CustomerEmail1
* Phone

In addition, the *Search* operator allows for partial search among all the available customer records:

* in case of FirstName, LastName, MiddleName, and EMail1, the indicated value is used to filter out customer records that start with that respective value
* in case of Phone, on the contrary, the records that end with the respective value are included in the output.

### JSON-based Sales Receipt Import API: Overriding restriction for Sales Receipts with sale and return items

`Build 6.32.52.0: PRO-4913`

Starting from version 6.32.52.0, we’ve changed the restrictions for importing a Sales Receipt that contains both sale and return items via JSON-based Sales Receipt Import API.

Now, if the *SuppressIsAllowMixedApiReceipt* setting is enabled at the database level, the respective Sales Receipt record is successfully created even if making sales and returns in one transaction is not allowed according to CHQ configurations.

## Issue Resolutions

### JSON-based TimeCard Export API: missing "EventType" values in API response

`Build 6.32.39.0: DS-1912`

**Issue**  
Prior to 6.32.39.0, as a result of export via JSON-based Time Card Export API, only `StartShift` value displayed in the *EventType* field in the API response. Other possible values, in particular, `StartBreak`, `EndBreak`, and `EndShift`, though displayed in the respective time card record in CHQ under `services > time card > [your time card record] > clock in-out`, would not get into the API request output.

**Resolution**  
The issue has been fixed. Now, all the available *EventType* values display in the API response as expected.

### Customer Invoice not sent via Mandrill

`Build 6.32.49.0: DS-1975`

We have fixed the issue where the *SendMail* task would fail to send Customer Invoice to the customer’s email via Mandrill on finalizing the sale in POS Pro V6.

### The Sync Customer Attributes job enhancement

`Build 6.32.52.0: DS-1935`

The Sync Customer Attributes job has been enhanced to process large amounts of data faster.

{{% notice info %}}
In Teamwork Commerce Pro suite, customer attributes can be added to a customer record both in the POS Pro app and in CHQ. To synchronize customer attributes between POS and CHQ, the Sync Customer Attributes job can be executed under `chq > settings > server tasks > jobs`.
{{% /notice %}}

### Big Query: Records missing in the PersonalInfo table

`Build 6.32.52.0: DS-2006`

**Issue**  
After exporting sales data from Teamwork’s database to BigQuery, in BigQuery, some records could fail to appear in the PersonalInfo table.

**Resolution**  
To help with this issue, we’ve added the StreamingDate field to the PersonalInfo table. Now, sales records are properly synchronized between Teamwork’s database and BigQuery.
