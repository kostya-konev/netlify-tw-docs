### Review Orders

`Build 6.41.37.0: PRO-10532`

Starting from version 6.41.37.0, we've added a new type of document — Review Orders (RVO) in Teamwork Commerce PRO Suite.

With the implementation of Review Orders, the following updates were made at the CHQ side:

- Review Order related fields were added to the V6 App Designer
- new settings for configuring the return period as well as specifying a credit memo item for deposits were added at the company level
- new security right was added.

Also, as a part of this update a new `review order` transaction email type was added as well as a new **review order** option was added to the printing options.

#### Purpose

A Review Order (RVO) is a potential sale in which items are sent to a customer for review. While the customer reviews the items, the items remain on hand in the store inventory, but not Available to Sell (ATS). The customer decides which items to keep and returns the rest, at which time the final sale is created for the items the customer kept.

The introduced functionality includes the following capabilities:

- adding items and a customer to a new RVO. A new RVO can remain in the Оn Hold status until it's ready for shipping/delivering
- releasing the RVO. The released Order is sent to the customer and can no longer be edited
- taking a deposit for the RVO. Deposits can be taken both at the time of releasing or after releasing
- converting the RVO into a Sales Receipt.

Returned items are added back to Available to Sell and logged at the database level for reporting purposes.

#### New security right

We've added the following new security rights for POS PRO:

Area | Right | Description |
:----------- |:----------- |:----------- |
Sales | View/Edit Review Orders | Allows the user to create, edit, and view Review Orders|

{{% notice note %}}
For information on how to assign security rights to users, see the **Roles** section of the [Cloud HQ User Manual: Settings](https://twdocs.netlify.app/userdoc/chq/manuals/ "CHQ Manual Version 6").

- **default return time**: defines the default time the merchandise is returned by the customer on the Review Order. The user can set any time, hour, minute, and AM/PM; empty by default
- **credit memo item for deposits**: click **select** next to the field to choose credit memo item to be added to Sales Receipts when creating a deposit for an RVO.

The **review order** printing area is available for selection in CHQ under `settings > printing > mobile printing designs > new > printing areas`.

#### Storing Review Orders data

When a Review Order (RVO) is converted to a regular Sales Receipt, information about the original state of the Review Order may be lost.

The retailer requires information to analyze the RVO data that is otherwise lost when the RVO is converted. In particular, the retailer needs to know what items were not sold (returned by the customer) when converting the RVO to a sales receipt.

This tab provides details about storing data for items on a Review Order (RVO) after it is converted to a Sales Receipt.

The following information on items from the Review Order is stored for reporting and analysis:

- **Review Order #**: the unique ID for the Review Order(RVO)
- **Date Created**: the date and time of the RVO creation
- **Created By**: the information on the user who created the RVO
- **Last Edit Date**: the date and time when the RVO was last edited
- **Last Edited by**: the information on the user who edited the RVO
- **Date Discarded**: the date and time when the RVO was discarded (no sale made)
- **Discarded by**: the information on who discarded the RVO
- **Discarded Location**: the location where the user selected discard for the RVO
- **Associate**: the associate on the RVO at the time it was released
- **Created Location**: the location where the RVO was created
- **Released Date**: the date and time when the RVO was released
- **Released By**: the information on the user who released the RVO
- **Released Location**: the location where  where RVO was released
- **Status**: the status of the RVO. Can be one of the following: `Released`, `On Hold`, `Discarded`, `Sale Complete`
- **Archived**: the checkbox to indicate if the RVO is archived.
- **Return Date**:  the date and time when the merchandise should be returned if not purchasing.

### Credit Memo service items

- to create a service item of the `credit memo` type
- to specify that item's PLU as a credit memo item PLU for sales
- to configure the display of the **Issue Credit Memo** option and the **Credit Memo** sections in various areas of POS PRO.

As a part of this update, we've also added a new security right.

#### Purpose

### Configuring multi-shift Drawer Memos for POS PRO

`Build 6.41.37.0: PRO-7816`

We've introduced the capability to open and close Drawer Memos that represent parts of a work shift in case a store associate works a split shift. At the end of the business day, such Drawer Memos can be linked together for a single day of sales.

In CHQ, to implement this update, we've added:

- two new drawer memo related settings
- two new security rights for POS PRO
- a new **Shift** field to the V6 App Designer.

#### Purpose

This feature is useful for companies where some employees may be assigned unique work schedules. In particular, this enhancement covers the case where a staff member may work a split shift, meaning that they have a non-working time period in between the working hours.

With this update, a staff member with such schedule has the capability to close the active Drawer Memo in POS for the non-working period by marking the closure as "end of shift" (the End of Day process is not required). When the employee's working hours are resumed, they open a new Drawer Memo by marking it as "start of shift" and linking the Memo to the first part of their shift. When the two parts of the shift are linked, drawer cash balance is automatically carried over, and the employee may continue ringing up sales without additional cash counting.

At the end of the business day, transaction details and cash balance from the linked Drawer Memos (parts of the shift) are automatically carried over to the End of Day process, ensuring that no sales data is lost.

This allows for accommodating employee's unique working schedules while ensuring both staff accountability and sales data integrity.

#### How to enable multi-shift Drawer Memos

{{% notice note %}}
As of version 6.41.37.0, multi-shift Drawer Memo feature cannot be enabled for company locations in Germany and Italy.
{{% /notice %}}

1. In CHQ, go to `settings > drawer management > drawer memo settings`.
2. In the **drawer memo** section, select the new **enable multi-shift options** checkbox (clear by default):
{{% gimg src="V6.41 CHQ Release Guide/641_chq_shift1.jpg" title="New settings in the drawer memo section" width="600px"%}}Additionally, to make a second user required to enter credentials when there is an over/short during SOD or EOD, select the **require second user login for drawer over/short verification** checkbox (clear by default).
3. **Save** your changes.

#### New security rights

We've added the following new security rights for POS PRO:

Area | Right | Description |
:----------- |:----------- |:----------- |
Drawer Memo | View/Edit drawer for another user | Allows the user to view/edit a drawer created by another user|
Drawer Memo | Verify drawer memo over/short | Allows the user to enter their credentials to verify a drawer memo that was over/short during end of day|

### Requiring the same associate for sales and Drawer Memo

`Build 6.41.37.0: PRO-7765`

As a fraud prevention measure, we've introduced the capability for the retailer to restrict sales on a Drawer Memo(DM) to the person who created the DM.

This update resulted in adding a new **require same associate as drawer memo for sales** setting at the company level in CHQ as well as adding new security right for POS PRO.

#### How to configure

1. In CHQ, go to `settings > sales > sales documents`.
2. In the **sales** section, select the new **require same associate as drawer memo for sales** checkbox (clear by default).  
When this setting is enabled, the person who created the Drawer Memo (completed the SOD), is the only person allowed to make sales.  
The logged in cashier must be the same user as the user specified in the Drawer Memo **created by** field.
{{% gimg src="V6.41 CHQ Release Guide/641_chq_associate1.jpg" title="New require same associate as drawer memo for sales setting" width="700px"%}}
{{% notice note %}}
Please note that when the **require same associate as drawer memo for sales** is enabled and the user doesn't have the **Override drawer memo user for sales** security right, this user cannot:

- start a new sale
- Unhold a Sales Receipt
- void/reverse a Sales Receipt.

Also, the cashier cannot be changed on an active Drawer Memo.
{{% /notice %}}
3. **Save** the changes.

#### New security right

We've added the following new security right for POS PRO:

Area | Right | Description |
:----------- |:----------- |:----------- |
Sales | Override drawer memo user for sales | Allows a user who did not start the Drawer Memo to make sales on the device|

The user who has the **Override drawer memo user for sales** security right can make sales even if this user is not the user specified in the Drawer Memo **created by** field.

If the user does not have the **Override drawer memo user for sales** security right, the user who created the Drawer Memo must be the person who makes sales on the POS device.

{{% notice note %}}

### OMS: New sales credit location setting

`Build 6.41.37.0: PRO-7884`

2. Click to select your location record and then click **edit**.

### Limiting open return refunds

`Build 6.41.37.0: PRO-10098`

### Order Management System: Support of Same Day Delivery and Ship to Store orders

`Build 6.41.49.0: PRO-11382`

To support Same Day Delivery and Ship to Store orders in Teamwork Commerce PRO, we've introduced a number of updates to CHQ areas related to order fulfillment.

{{% notice info %}}
**Same Day Delivery** orders are placed on an eCommerce website, filled at a company location, and then delivered to customers via a courier service. As of version 6.41, Same Day Delivery orders can only be imported in CHQ from an external system.  

**Ship to Store** orders are placed on an eCommerce website and then picked up by the customer in a store. If the required items are not in stock at the requested pickup location, such items are transferred to that location to ensure the Ship to Store order is fulfilled.  
{{% /notice %}}

The following CHQ areas have been updated:

- settings
- order management
- transfer orders
- transfer memos

#### Settings

##### Order Fill Logic: Configuring fulfillment of Store Pickup, Ship to Store, and Same Day Delivery orders

Under `settings > order management > order fulfillment > order fill logic`, we've added new Order Fill Logic (OFL) steps that define how Store Pickup, Ship to Store, and Same Day Delivery orders are fulfilled.
{{% notice tip %}}
To enable an OFL step, select the **active** checkbox next to the respective step and then adjust priority by clicking **move up** and **move down** at the top-left.
{{% /notice %}}

**OFL step**|**Description**|
:-----------|:-----------|
**Ship To Store for Store Pick Up Order**|For Sales Orders with **delivery method** = `store pick up`, when desired items are not available at the fill location, this step creates:<br>a) Ship to Store Ship Memo (SM) for that fill location<br>b) Transfer Order to deliver the required items to the fill location.<br> SM is created in the `transfer/prepare` status. If items are transferred from multiple locations, an SM is created for each fill location/transfer source location combination.<br>Transfer source location is defined based on the **Ship to Store transfer locations** matrix (see [Configuring location availability for Ship To Store transfers](#configuring-location-availability-for-ship-to-store-transfers)) and respecting the **Ship to Store priority sources** configuration (see [Configuring priority of Ship To Store transfer locations](#configuring-priority-of-ship-to-store-transfer-locations)).|
**Ship To Store for Ship To Store Order**|For Sales Orders with **delivery method** = `ship to store`, this step creates a Ship to Store SM for the fill location and a Transfer Order to deliver the required items to that fill location.|
**Store Pick Up for Ship To Store Order - if ATS for selected location**|For Sales Orders with **delivery method** = `ship to store`, if the desired items are already available at the fill location, this step creates a Store Pickup SM for that location. The SM is created in the `prepare pick up` status.|
**Same Day Delivery - if ATS for selected location**|For Sales Orders with **delivery method** = `same day delivery`, this step creates a Same Day Delivery SM for the fill location. The SM is created in the  `prepare pick up` status.|

###### Configuring location availability for Ship to Store transfers
<a name="configuring-availability-of-locations-for-ship-to-store-transfers"></a>
The new **ship to store transfer locations** area under `settings > order management > order fulfillment > STS transfer locations` allows users to define company locations that can be used as source locations when OFL creates a Ship to Store transfer:
{{% gimg src="V6.41 CHQ Release Guide/641_chq_ofl1.jpg" width="700px"%}}
{{% notice note %}}
Please be advised that in this case **target location** is the Ship to Store order fill location.
{{% /notice %}}

To enable a source location/target location combination, select the checkbox at the respective intersection.

###### Configuring priority of Ship to Store transfer locations
<a name="configuring-priority-of-ship-to-store-transfer-locations"></a>
The new **ship to store priority sources** area under `settings > order management > order fulfillment > STS priority sources` allows users to define priority in which source locations are used when OFL creates a Ship to Store transfer.
{{% gimg src="V6.41 CHQ Release Guide/641_chq_ofl2.jpg" width="700px"%}}
{{% notice note %}}
Please be advised that the rankings start from zero (`0`) as the highest priority. For example, a ranking of `2` has a lower priority than a ranking of `1`, but a higher priority than a ranking of `3`.<br>
If several locations have the same rank, the one with bigger available-to-fill item quantity will have a higher priority.
{{% /notice %}}

##### New order fulfillment settings

Under `settings > order management > order fulfillment > order fulfillment settings >` the `general` section, we've added the following company-level settings:

**Setting**|**Description**|
:-----------|:-----------|
**rejected item - excluded reject reasons**|If, in a Ship Memo, an item is rejected with a reason specified in this setting, that item is not blocked for order fulfillment|

If a shipping delay is expected, an alert is linked both to the SM and associated Sales Order.

### Support of External Ship Memos

`Build 6.41.49.0: PRO-10186`

In Teamwork Commerce PRO Suite, we've added support of Ship Memos (SMs) imported from an external order management system – External Ship Memos (EXSMs).

To respect this update, a new **allow to change ship to address for existing orders (external)** setting was added to CHQ.

#### Purpose

Introduction of EXSMs allows retailers to use their preferred order management system (OMS) in conjunction with Teamwork Commerce PRO Suite.

An external Ship Memo is imported into CHQ, validated, and then synchronized with the POS PRO app. Once processed in POS, the SM is exported back to the external OMS.

The same as with internal SMs, EXSMs can be of the following four types:

- Ship to Customer
- Store Pick Up
- Ship to Store
- Same Day Delivery

#### External Ship Memo in settings

We've made available a new **allow to change ship to address for existing orders (external)** setting under `settings > order management > customer orders >` the `web and send sales` section:
{{% gimg src="V6.41 CHQ Release Guide/641_chq_EXSM.jpg" width="700px"%}}
Enabling this setting allows users in POS PRO to change ship-to address in external Ship Memos (enabled by default).

Additionally, the **allow to change ship to address for existing orders (TW)** setting has been updated to control only internal Ship Memos.

{{% gimg src="V6.41 CHQ Release Guide/641_chq_GC2.jpg" width="600px"%}}

As of version 6.41.137.0, we've added the capability to assign verified returns of items to location these items were sold from. Verified returns in this case must be processed by POS PRO Version 6.

This update resulted in adding a new **items sold from this location assigned here on return** setting at the location level.

Also, as a part of this update, we've removed the **auto transfer when returning from another location** setting previously available in the **returns** section of CHQ under `settings > sales > sales documents`.

#### Purpose

Enabling the new **items sold from this location assigned here on return** allows the retailer to auto-fill the **Returns Assigned to** location field visible on the **Verified Return** area in POS PRO.

The value defined in the **Returns Assigned to** field displays as read-only and is applied to all the return items, meaning that they have the same return location.

{{% notice note %}}
Please be advised when the retailer defines the **Returns Assigned to** location in CHQ, Sales Receipts can no longer include  sale and return items simultaneously.<br>
Sales and returns must be processed on separate receipts.<br>
Open returns are always returned to the POS initialized location.

#### How to configure

1. In CHQ, go to `settings > location settings > locations / location settings`.
2. Click to select your location record and then click **edit**.
3. In the dialog that opens, go to the **sales** tab.
4. In the **sales** section, select the new **items sold from this location assigned here on return** checkbox:

### External Ship Memos: On Hand and Committed Qty

`Build 6.41.137.0: PRO-12961`

We've added the functionality to handle on hand and committed qty affected by External Ship Memos (SMs). In particular, the following updates were made:

- when External SM is created, we will commit qty in the Ship Memo location
- when External SM is finalized, we will uncommit qty and create a negative qty adjustment (to reduce on hand qty) in the Ship Memo location
- when posting a Sales Receipt linked to an External SM, we will create a positive qty adjustment (to offset on hand qty reduced by the sales receipt).

As a part of this update, the **external ship memo ID** field has been added to the Adjustment Memo and Sales Receipt tables at the database level.

### Configuring Global Payments in CHQ

`Build 6.41.151.0: PRO-9967`

As of version 6.41.151.0, we've updated the existing as well as added new settings to support the Global Payments credit card processing in POS PRO V6.

As a part of this update, we've renamed a list of sections at the company and location levels.

Also, we've added Global Payments as a payment terminal option at the device level.

#### Purpose

{{% notice info %}}
Global Payments is a leading global provider of payment card solutions for financial institutions and retail companies.  
Global Payments is available in approximately 80 countries worldwide with about 200 clients.<br>
Global Payments acquired TSYS, which had previously acquired Cayan.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice warning %}}
In POS PRO V6, all the Cayan-related sections have been renamed to Global Payments.

However, in **Teamwork POS V4**, the Cayan-related sections will remain Cayan.
{{% /notice %}}

Global Payments works in conjunction with Genius terminal payment processing for POS PRO V6.

Please be advised that to support integration with Global Payments across CHQ, the following must be configured:

- Global Payments must be set up as the payment processor at the company and location levels
- Global Payments must be defined as the payment processor at the payment method level
- Global Payments must be сonfigured as the payment terminal type for your POS PRO device

#### Updated Global Payments related sections

Starting from version 6.41, instead of Cayan, we use Global Payments across CHQ and POS PRO V6. This change resulted in renaming a number of UI elements in CHQ:

1. At the company level, under `chq > sales > payment processing`, the **cayan** section has been renamed to **Global Payments**:
{{% gimg src="V6.41 CHQ Release Guide/641_chq_GP1.jpg" width="600px"%}}
2. At the location level, under `chq > location settings > locations / location settings > [your location] > edit > payments`, the **payment processing - cayan** section has been renamed to **payment processing - Global Payments**:
{{% gimg src="V6.41 CHQ Release Guide/641_chq_GP2.jpg" width="400px"%}}
3. At the payment method level, under `chq > settings > sales > payment methods > [your Credit Card record] > location settings > [selected location] > edit`, in the **payment processing** field, the `cayan` option has been renamed to `Global Payments` for the **payment processing** field:
{{% gimg src="V6.41 CHQ Release Guide/641_chq_GP3.jpg" width="450px"%}}

#### Configuring connection to Global Payments payment terminal

To configure connection between the POS device and the Global Payments terminal, in CHQ:

1. Go to `services > device controller`.
2. Find your device and click it.
3. In the **edit device** dialog that opens, go to the **app settings** tab.
4. In the **payment terminal type** field of the **payment terminal** section, choose `Global Payments` (see the screenshot below):
{{% gimg src="V6.41 CHQ Release Guide/641_chq_GP4.jpg" width="600px"%}}
Selecting `Global Payments` enables the following fields for configuration:
Setting  | Description | 
:---------- | :----------- | 
**host name** | The URL for connection to your payment terminal. Empty by default; required, max 50 characters.|
**terminal ID** | The unique ID of your terminal. <br> Terminal ID typically consists of several blocks: characters and digits, a hyphen, and then 9 digits. For example, **P400**-*123456789*. The max length of terminal ID is 24 symbols. Empty by default; required|
**port** | The port number used to connect to your payment terminal. `8443` is set by default; required|

### Review Orders added to the Committed Qty Ledger

`Build 6.41.178.0: PRO-13544`

### Refunding a Sales Order deposit to Credit Memo

`Build 6.41.178.0: PRO-13601`

In version 6.41.178.0, we’ve introduced the capability to refund an unused Sales Order deposit automatically to a Credit Memo. This is done if the original payment was made with: 

- Cash
- Credit Memo (**payment type** = `credit memo` defined under `chq > settings > sales > payment methods`)
- Offline Payment (**payment type** = `offline payment` defined under `chq > settings > sales > payment methods`)
- Offline Card Payment (**payment type** = `credit card` and the **disable integrated processing** checkbox selected under `chq > settings > sales > payment methods > [your Credit Card payment method] > location settings > [your location] > edit`)
- Credit Card Payment with an integrated credit card processor (for example: `Banorte`, `Clover` or `Global Payments`).

Previously, there was no capability to refund the customer via Teamwork OMS **cancel** action if the customer’s send sale order was paid using one of the payment methods listed above.

### Configuring the attribute values for display in POS PRO

`Build 6.41.207.0: PRO-14300`

In version 6.41.207.0, we’ve introduced the capability to define value types that display in **Attribute 1** and **Attribute 2** fields of various documents in POS PRO V6.

{{% notice tip %}}
This change is applied to the following POS areas in both active and historical documents:

- SalesReceipts: ShowCustomerDiscountInSubtotals
- SalesReceipts: ShowMemberDiscountInSubtotals
- SalesReceipts: ShowGlobalDiscountsInSubtotals

If the value of the settings is set to `1`, the respective information on Customer, Member, and Global discounts is printed in the Subtotals section of Sales Receipt.

Additionally, equivalent information on discounts is now available in Mandrill Sales Receipt email notifications.

### New method added to Public Secure CRM Customers API

`Build 6.41.238.0: DS-4483`

We’ve added the **Search for a customer (V1)** method Public Secure CRM Customers API. This enhancement allows for searching for customers by specific fields you indicate in the API request.

## Issue resolutions

### Import of Sales Orders with negative total is allowed

`Build 6.41.114.0: DS-3504`

**Issue**  
Prior to version 6.41.114.0, XML-based Sales Order Import API incorrectly allowed for importing Sales Orders with negative total amounts. That happened when both item-level and transaction-level (global) discounts were applied to the Sales Order.

**Resolution**  
To resolve this issue, we've corrected how global discounts are applied if item-level discounts are already applied to the Sales Order.

In particular, now the global discount is distributed among the eligible items proportionally to the items’ prices after applying item-level discounts. If the item’s price *after* item-level discount application is less than the global discount amount, then SO import fails with an error.

### Unable to access Looker dashboards

`Build 6.41.114.0: DS-3479`

When running any dashboard under `chq > analytics > dashboards`, an empty page could occasionally display. This happened due to the update of the dashboard routes on the Looker side.

We’ve fixed the issue. Now dashboards display as expected.

### Updated Looker API

`Build 6.41.114.0: DS-3994`

We've introduced changes at the database level to ensure that the updated version of Looker API is used in conjunction with CHQ.

### Sales Order Export APIs: Failure to execute requests with the Device Transaction Number filter applied

`Build 6.41.114.0: DS-4008`

We've fixed the issue where exporting Sales Orders could return an error if the **Device Transaction Number** filter was configured in the API request. This applies to JSON-based Sales Order Export API, JSON-based Sales Order Full Export API and JSON-based Ship Sales Order Export APIs.

### Inability to access the order management area

`Build 6.41.122.0: DS-3253`

We’ve fixed the issue where accessing the order management area under `chq > sales > order management` could occasionally fail due to the execution timeout error.

### Sales Order auto-process task failure

`Build 6.41.122.0: DS-4091`

We’ve fixed the issue where the Sales Order auto-process task could occasionally fail with the `Procedure or function 'SalesOrder_AutoProcess_IssueShipToStoreForStorePickUpOrder' expects parameter '@DeliveryMethod', which was not supplied` error message under `chq > settings > server tasks > tasks`. The issue caused the lack of the shipping method information at the item level for manually generated Ship Memos.

### JSON-based Sales Receipt Export API fails

`Build 6.41.122.0: DS-4102`

We've fixed the issue where exporting Sales Receipts via JSON-based Sales Receipt Export API with the **DeviceTransactionNumber** filter applied could fail. This could occasionally happen due to the incorrect work of the **ShipRequestMemoSetting** setting.

### Inability to create a new Drawer Memo

`Build 6.41.122.0: DS-4099`

We’ve fixed the issue where creating a new Drawer Memo on any device at any location could fail with the `The type initializer for "Teamwork.MobileService.API.Utils.ServiceProvider" threw an exception.` error message.

### Incorrect Offer Price for returns

`Build 6.41.137.0: DS-4118`

Prior to 6.41.137.0, the offer price for returns could occasionally be positive in Sales Receipts created in Teamwork POS Version 4.

The issue has been fixed. Now, the offer price is negative for the returns as expected.

### JSON-based Secure Customer Export API: Incorrect value returned in CountryIdentifier

`Build 6.41.137.0: DS-4115`

**Issue**  
Prior to 6.41.137.0, when executing the JSON-based Secure Customer Export API call with the **CountryIdentifierSetting** set to `Code`, the **CountryIdentifier** value in the API response could occasionally fail to match the value defined for the customer in the **country** field under `chq > sales > customers > [selected customer] > ship to > [selected ship to address] > edit`.

**Resolution**  
The issue has been fixed. Now, the **CountryIdentifier** value in the API response matches the value from CHQ as expected.

### JSON-based Sales Order Export and JSON-based Sales Order Full Export APIs: Missing the RMANo field in response

`Build 6.41.137.0: DS-4130`

We’ve fixed the issue where the **RMANo** field (items level) would be missing from the response to the JSON-based Sales Order Export and JSON-based Sales Order Full Export API calls.

### Finalize return and cancel buttons inactive in the refund dialog

`Build 6.41.137.0: DS-3022`

We've fixed the issue where the **finalize return** and **cancel** buttons could occasionally be inactive in the **refund** dialog in CHQ under `sales > returns manager > [your RMA Order] > refund`.

### JSON-based Sales Order History Export API fails

`Build 6.41.151.0: DS-4173`

In version 6.41.151.0, we've fixed the issue where JSON-based Sales Order History Export API calls would return the `Invalid column name 'GifteeEmail'` error message.

### Empty ship to section in Ship Memos

`Build 6.41.151.0: DS-4112`

Prior to 6.41.151.0, the **ship to** section could remain empty in Ship Memos if the respective information was absent at the item level of Sales Orders.

The issue has been fixed. Now, the **ship to** section in Ship Memos is populated as expected based on the ship to information from the Sales Order level proper.

### Customer membership recalculated on a wrong date

`Build 6.41.178.0: DS-4223`

We’ve fixed the issue where the customer membership could occasionally be recalculated one day after the specified recalculation day.

{{% notice note %}}
Please note the membership calculation settings are available for configuration under `chq > settings > customer > membership calculation`.
{{% /notice %}}

### Creating new EC ATS Control Orders is blocked by purging old records

`Build 6.41.178.0: DS-4194`

We’ve fixed the issue where purging old records by the **EcommQtyEchoTablePurge** job could occasionally block creation of new EC ATS Control Orders.

### JSON-based EC ATS Delta Export API: Return of items with “0” EcAtsDelta not allowed

`Build 6.41.193.0: DS-4109`

As of version 6.41.193.0, the JSON-based EC ATS Delta Export API does not allow for returning items with **EcAtsDelta** = `0`.

### Searching fails in the Shipments area of POS PRO V6

`Build 6.41.193.0: DS-4272`

In version 6.41.193.0, we’ve fixed the issue in CHQ that prevented from searching by **Document #** and **Order #** in POS PRO V6 under `Shipments > Outgoing` and `Shipments > Incoming`. In POS PRO, the `No matching documents found` error message displayed in this case. 

### Imported Count Memo Adjustments froze in the "in process" status

`Build 6.41.193.0: DS-4258`

We’ve fixed the issue where documents created via JSON-based Count Memo Adjustment Import API froze in the `in process` status under `chq > settings > server tasks > API calls`.

### Duplicate transaction records for Gift Card payments

`Build 6.41.193.0: DS-4281`

**Issue**  
Prior to 6.41.193.0, on creation of a Gift Card transaction via the Create a Gift Card transaction JSON-based Public API, this transaction was not linked to the related Gift Card payment from the imported Sales Order. As a result, a duplicate transaction was added during deposit receipt creation. This could be verified under `chq > sales > gift cards > your gift card > edit > transactions`.

**Resolution**  
The issue has been fixed. Now, the Gift Card transaction that was created via the Create a Gift Card transaction JSON-based Public API is utilized during deposit receipt creation as expected.

### SalesOrderItem.GiftCardPin incorrectly populated at the database level

`Build 6.41.193.0: DS-4306`

We’ve fixed the issue where the **GiftCardPin** field in the **SalesOrderItem** table of the CHQ database was incorrectly populated instead of remaining empty on completion of a Sales Order with a virtual Gift Card on it.   

### Customer information removed during Sales Order cancellation via JSON-based Sales Order Import API

`Build 6.41.197.0: DS-4351`

We’ve fixed the issue where canceling a Sales Order via JSON-based Sales Order Import API could occasionally remove the customer related information from the respective Sales Order.

### JSON-based Secure Customer Import API call froze in the “in process” status

`Build 6.41.197.0: DS-4305`

**Issue**  
Prior to 6.41.197.0, JSON-based Secure Customer Import API calls could occasionally remain in the `in process` status. This happened when the **KeyField** setting was set to `MembershipCode` in the API request.

**Resolution**  
The issue has been fixed. Now, as expected, a new customer record is created in CHQ as a result of execution of JSON-based Secure Customer Import API call with **KeyField** = `MembershipCode`.

### JSON-based Sales Receipt Export API: Removed extra space after DrawerMemoIdentifier

`Build 6.41.207.0: DS-4057`

In the JSON-based Sales Receipt Export API response, we’ve removed an extra space after the **DrawerMemoIdentifier** attribute name.

### JSON-based Adjustment Export API returns an error

`Build 6.41.207.0: DS-4373`

Prior to version 6.41.207.0, the JSON-based Adjustment Export API could return an error when, in the API request, the **DeviceTransactionNumber** filter was applied. The issue occurred because the **ShipRequestMemoIdentifier** field could not retrieve information from the respective table.

To resolve this issue, we’ve fixed how data is fetched for **ShipRequestMemoIdentifier**. Now, the JSON-based Adjustment Export API works as expected.

### Delay when placing Sales Receipts on hold in POS PRO V6

`Build 6.41.207.0: DS-4388`

In version 6.41.207.0, we’ve fixed the issue in CHQ that caused a delay in placing the first Sales Receipt of the day on hold in POS PRO V6.

### CHQ reports cannot be accessed under specific conditions

`Build 6.41.207.0: DS-4373`

**Issue**  
CHQ users sometimes could not access reports under `chq > analytics > reports` after taking specific actions. In particular, the issue could occur after:

- the user had run a report and then returned to the `analytics > reports` area while the report was running, or
- the user had run several reports in succession and then canceled before any of the reports yielded results

**Resolution**  
The issue occurred when the report’s "Finished" date was earlier than the "Started" date. That happened due to a mismatch in time calculations between CHQ and the database engine.

We’ve introduced updates at the backend to prevent this issue. Now, CHQ reports can be accessed and run as expected.

### CHQ fails to process a Sales Order

`Build 6.41.207.0: DS-4385`

Prior to version 6.41.207.0, CHQ could fail to process a Send Sale finalized in POS. That happened when the Send Sale included a Virtual Gift Card and an item with an associated digital asset.

The issue occurred because the generated **SalesOrderNo** value wasn’t supplied to the SalesOrder table at the backend. Instead, the system attempted to populate the **SalesOrderNo** field with the `NULL` value, which isn’t allowed.

To resolve this issue, we’ve fixed how the **SalesOrderNo** value is passed at the backend. Now, Sales Orders resulting from POS Send Sale transactions are processed as expected.

### The Purchase Order QtyReceived value incorrectly calculated at the database level

`Build 6.41.207.0: DS-4395`

We’ve fixed the issue where the value in the Purchase Order (PO) **QtyReceived** field at the database level could be incorrectly calculated on discarding Purchase Order. This happened as the IsDeleted flag was ignored for an item from the discarded PO.

### Inability to access the digital assets (echo) dialog from the selected style

`Build 6.41.207.0: DS-4226`

In version 6.41.207.0, we’ve fixed the issue where accessing the **digital assets (echo)** dialog for the selected style failed with the timeout error.

{{% notice note %}}
To access the **digital assets (echo)** dialog, in CHQ go to `inventory > styles & items > [your style]`, then click the **digital assets (echo)** button.
{{% /notice %}}

### Inability to discard a held Sales Receipt from POS PRO V6

`Build 6.41.207.0: DS-4378`

Prior to version 6.41.207.0, POS users were sometimes unable to discard a held Sales Receipt due to the `Server Unavailable` error.

We’ve introduced an update at the backend that resolves this issue. Now, held Sales Receipts can be discarded normally.

### Fixes related to setting Gift Card balance

`Build 6.41.207.0: PRO-14154`

We’ve fixed minor errors in how data is processed and communicated at the backend when the balance of a Gift Card is defined. This fix prevents situations where a Gift Card can be incorrectly recharged twice.

### Database maintenance updates

`Build 6.41.207.0: PRO-14154`

We’ve introduced maintenance updates to provide for the optimal performance of the database engine.

### Database update failed

`Build 6.41.207.0: PRO-14107`

We’ve fixed the backend issue that caused the CHQ update to fail with an error.

### Scheduler fails with the "Out of memory" exception

`Build 6.41.221.0: DS-4439`

Prior to version 6.41.221.0, CHQ Scheduler could sometimes fail with the `Out of memory` exception and then restart.

The issue occurred when an email task was scheduled for a sales receipt that didn’t exist in the system. That caused a large number of email tasks to be generated until the Scheduler ran out of memory.

To resolve the issue, we’ve introduced batch processing for email tasks. Now, CHQ Scheduler works as expected.

### Sync issue between CHQ servers

`Build 6.41.221.0: DS-4482`

Clients employing multiple CHQ servers for different countries could experience issues with the servers’ synchronization. Due to the sync issues, prices on one of the servers sometimes failed to update timely.

We’ve resolved this issue. Now, CHQ servers synchronize data as expected.

### Inability to create a Ship Memo for Sales Order

`Build 6.41.221.0: DS-4472`

**Issue**  
Under `chq > sales > order management > list`, it was impossible to ship a Sales Order via the **create SM** action if the auto process (the **run auto process** option) had been already run for that Order.

Order processing failed because the scheduled task generated by the create SM option conflicted with the auto process tasks.

**Resolution**  
To resolve the issue, we’ve updated the auto process to exclude Sales Orders for which the **create SM** action was selected. Now, Sales Orders are processed as expected.

### Unable to sync POS Version 4

`Build 6.41.221.0: DS-4394`

We’ve fixed the issue where POS Version 4 working in conjunction with CHQ Version 6 failed to sync displaying the `Value of member 'Birthdate' of an object of type 'SecureCustomer' changed. A member that is computed or generated by the database cannot be changed` error message.

### Unable to parse the Adyen Payment Accounting report

`Build 6.41.221.0: DS-4506`

We’ve fixed the issue where the Sales\ParseAdyenPaymentAccountingReport task failed with the `Cannot add an entity with a key that is already in use` error message. This task extracts data from the Adyen Payment Accounting Report that is used by Teamwork to prepare reports on Adyen payments.

### Incorrect record types extracted from the Adyen Settlement Details Report

`Build 6.41.221.0: DS-4456`

We’ve fixed the issue where the Sales\ParseAdyenSettlementDetailsReport task incorrectly extracted records of the `MerchantPayout` and `Fee` types. This, in turn, didn’t allow for generation of the Teamwork Adyen Refund Status report.

### Avalara integration: Retry logic for Sales Receipt sending

`Build 6.41.221.0: DS-4456`

We’ve added the retry logic to SendReceiptsToAvalaraTaskProcessor. This logic allows for making additional attempts to send Sales Receipts to Avalara in case an error occurs.

### The 'Accept SalesOrder' task fails for Sales Orders with Virtual Gift Cards

`Build 6.41.233.0: DS-4413`

We’ve fixed the issue where, after importing a Sales Order in the `approved` status with a Virtual Gift Card in it, the respective order could occasionally freeze in the `in review` status under `chq > sales > order management > [your sales order]`. 

This happened because the Accept SalesOrders task for that Sales Order failed with the `Invalid object name 'dbo.ReceiptItem'` error message. In version 6.41 of the software, at the database level, the dbo.ReceiptItem table does not exist and Sales.ReceiptItem is used instead.

### POS version 4.93 fails to synchronize with CHQ version 6.41 after changing password

`Build 6.41.233.0: DS-4304`

We’ve fixed the issue where, after changing the password of the root user in CHQ, the synchronization of POS V4.93 with CHQ V6.41 failed with the `Un-synchronized Receipts` error message.

### Duplicate refund attempt sent to Adyen

`Build 6.41.233.0: DS-4542`

We've fixed the issue where the refund attempt with the Adyen Credit Card payment processor could be performed twice for the same item. This happened if the second refund attempt was created before the first attempt was successfully completed.

### RMA worksheet freezes in the "pending" status

`Build 6.41.233.0: DS-4569`

We’ve fixed the issue where imported RMA worksheets with the “global-e” payment could freeze in the `pending` status. This happened as validation for AccountNumber was incorrectly performed although this attribute is not used for Global-E refunds. 

### Sales Receipt failed to post

`Build 6.41.233.0: DS-4532`

We’ve fixed the issue where no scheduled task was created automatically to post Sales Receipts at the database level.
### Sales Order payment information not updated

`Build 6.41.233.0: DS-4568`

Prior to version 6.41.233.0, the payment status of a Sales Order (SO) sometimes failed to be updated timely. In particular, under `sales > order management > [selected SO] > order >` the **total** section:

- the **cc authorized amount** field still displayed a positive amount
- the **deposit used** field displayed `0.00` even if the order had been already shipped

{{% notice note %}}
Once the deposit has been used at the time of shipping, the **cc authorized amount** field should no longer display a positive amount. Instead, the **deposit used** field must show the amount that has been used for shipping. 
{{% /notice %}}

The issue occurred because the Sales\ShipShipMemo task didn’t retry to update the SO if the first update attempt failed.

The issue has been fixed. Now, SO payment status is updated timely as expected. 

### SalesReceiptItemId incorrectly populated for rejected items

`Build 6.41.238.0: DS-4631`

**Issue**  
Prior to version 6.41.238.0, if there were several items with the same PLU on a Sales Order added as separate lines and one was shipped and the other rejected, the rejected one incorrectly had SalesReceiptItemID value populated at the database level, while the shipped one didn’t have any.

**Resolution**  
The issue has been fixed. Now, as expected, shipped items have their SalesReceiptItemId values populated and rejected items don’t have this value at the database level.
