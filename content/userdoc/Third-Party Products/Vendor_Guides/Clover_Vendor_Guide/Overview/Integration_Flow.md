To summarize the integration flow:  
1. Payment requests will be generated by POS PRO and passed to the *CloverConnector*.  
2. The *CloverConnector* will send payment requests via a LAN to the **Secure Network Pay Display** (**SNPD**) app running on the Clover device.  
3. The customer will interact with the SNPD app on the Clover device to complete a payment.  
4. The SNPD app will send a response to the *CloverConnector*.  
5. The POS PRO app will handle the response.
