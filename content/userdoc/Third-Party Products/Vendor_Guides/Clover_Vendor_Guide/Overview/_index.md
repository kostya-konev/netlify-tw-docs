## Task checklist {#TaskChecklist}

The task checklist is, as one would expect, a list of the tasks which need to be performed to prepare a retailer to utilize the Adyen integration. The task list is currently maintained in the [Clover Vendor Guide Task Checklist](https://teamworkclients.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TWDocs/pages/3716677680/Clover+Vendor+Guide+Task+Checklist) page in Confluence.

## Vendor contacts {#VendorContacts}

If it is necessary to contact anyone at the vendor, the Teamwork Strategic Partner Manager should be emailed at partner@teamworkcommerce.com describing why the contact is needed and you will be supplied with the current contact information.

## Marketing contact interval {#MarketingContactInterval}

See the [Clover Vendor Guide Task Checklist](https://teamworkclients.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TWDocs/pages/3716677680/Clover+Vendor+Guide+Task+Checklist) page in Confluence for the current contact interval.

## Supported hardware {#SupportedHardware}

The hardware supported by POS PRO is listed in the [POS PRO Certified Hardware list](https://teamworkclients.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TD/pages/3330867222/POS+Pro+Certified+Hardware+list) available in Confluence.
