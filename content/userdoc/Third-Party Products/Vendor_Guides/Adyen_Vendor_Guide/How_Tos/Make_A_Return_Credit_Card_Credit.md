The *Credit Card Credit* payment method is typically used to make a refund to the customer’s credit card. This is typically done as a part of a merchandise return.

Accordingly, after the customer swipes, inserts, or touches their card to the terminal, the funds are returned to the customer’s card instead of being debited.

The steps to making a *Credit Card Credit* payment in POS PRO are similar to accepting a credit card payment.

To make a Credit Card Credit payment in POS PRO you should do the following:

1. In the **Sales Receipt** area, once the return item(s) and a customer (if required) are added to the receipt, tap **Payment**.  
2. In the **Payment** area that opens, tap **Credit Card Credit**:
