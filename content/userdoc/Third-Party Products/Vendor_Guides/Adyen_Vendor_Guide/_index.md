With easy in-store deployments and a seamless integration, Adyen Terminal API empowers retailers to streamline their operations.

**Purpose:**  
Adyen is a payment service provider that services in-store and online payments. Adyen has a plethora of in-store payment terminals with features such as *Tap* and *Line Item Display*.

With the Adyen integration, it is possible for the retailer to accept and process credit card payments as well as make refunds to customersâ€™ credit cards.

In the future, the Adyen integration will be supported via a payment cartridge. A payment cartridge is a backend integration which implements support for a specific payment processor.

All payment cartridges will work in conjunction with the frontend Unified User Interface (Unified UI, UUI). The UUI concept is based on the idea of providing a single POS user interface which will be the same for all payment processors.
